# Cabin Yearly Timeline

A rough timeline for buying land and building a series of increasingly
complex structures culminating finally with moving full time into a
livable cabin / tiny house.

## 2021

The first year is about securing the land, setting up a temporary space
I can work from part time, and learning how to build stuff.

I’ll try to start by constructing a small cellar-like storage area,
buried into the ground where I can store a tent and all supplies for
setting up the temporary workspace that aren’t safe to keep outdoors
year-round.

(And maybe first an even simpler storage box for tools so I can leave
them safely onsite, too…)

By the summer, with the temporary space setup, I’ll start building the
first tiny structure – a tiny cabin similar to one I saw someone else
build with a minimal foundation and a single window & door, as well as a
wood stove.

By the winter it should be possible to use the tiny house as my part
time work space instead of an outdoor tent.

Besides my dayjob, some of my time working here will be toward small
projects meant to help me transition back to being mostly self-employed
after I finally move out of my apartment. Developing pay-what-you-want
audio tools, creating some web service side projects, etc…

This year should also be the start of a process of getting rid of crap
I’ve been storing but will never need and/or would just clutter up the
cabin. I’ll need as much leeway as I can to clutter it up good with
records and books anyway. ;-)

I should also work on switching to a lower power setup at home, use
solar at the temporary tent site, and start making meals that would be
easy to make with the facilities I’ll have in the final fulltime cabin.
(So also think about what those should be!)

* January - June: Save for deposit on land purchase loan

* June: have property assessed & buy it

* June: begin hideaway box build & save for tiny house construction

* July: setup temporary tented remote work space, stored primarily in
hideawy box

* August: begin tiny house construction

* November: finish tiny house construction & move work space inside

* December: enjoy tiny house, continue to setup inside

## 2022

The second year is about getting more serious about tiny house
construction, and investigating plumbing hookups. (It would be possible
to go fully on-grid here, but running water & waste disposal of some
kind is all I’m interested in long-term. Otherwise as long as I still
can get a phone signal to tether to an internet connection, and I can
rig up enough solar power for my needs, water & trash should be the only
services I’ll buy into in the long term.

This second tiny house should also strive to meet the requirements for a
Minnesota dwelling, as practice for the final fulltime cabin.

* January - March: save for second tiny house

* March - September: second tiny house construction – add plumbing?

* September - December: enjoy second tiny house, save for cabin
construction

## 2023

The third year I’ll just save and try to start construction on the
fulltime cabin as soon as possible. Likely red tape will suck, though at
least Minnesota has special rules for tiny houses that seem a bit less
hardcore than those for a dwelling larger than 500 square feet.

I really doubt I will be able to build the cabin in a single year. If
so, because of the timing of my apartment lease, nothing would change
anyway besides having much more time to finish moving out.

This year I’ll still only be using the tiny houses as a part time work
space and living full time at my apartment.

By this time I’d like to have a financial plan in place for when I go
into the cabin full time and transition back to part time or contract
work so I can budget and save accordingly.

* January - March: enjoy second tiny house, keep saving

* March - September: cabin construction

* September - December: stop cabin construction

## 2024

The fourth year I’ll do my best to finish the cabin enough so it is
ready to live in during the winter, and ready to move into full time the
following year. We’ll see!

* January - March: stop cabin construction

* March - September finish cabin

* September - December: enjoy cabin

## 2025

The fifth year I’ll actually move out of my apartment and move in to the
cabin full time with my cat.

At this point consider splitting a small commerical space in town to
make a hackerspace with friends, and do electronics work there… maybe
house a community server there as well.

* January - March: enjoy cabin & move rest of stuff out of apartment

* March: Move Louis to cabin

* April: give up lease on apartment

* May: setup hackerspace?

Well, I only ended up writing a short rant about Peabo Bryson & Roberta Flack's _Born To Love_, so here it is.

## In Defense of _Born To Love_

If you can set aside the incredibly schlocky 80s love ballad lyrics -- heavy-handed and precisely dramatic gestures of eternal love and 
everything is forever and boundless etc etc. Just get over it, because underneath there is actually a lot of great music on _Born To Love_. 

_Blame It On Me_ and _Heaven Above Me_ feel like stand-outs but the winner of top-schlock lyrical content while remaining a pretty great song 
is the groan-worthy _Tonight, I Celebrate My Love_. Really, get over it and bask in the rolling waves of rhodes-like guitar and soft arrangements.

The record stays surprisingly on point until _Comin' Alive_. Just skip that one, and maybe call it a day after _I Just Came Here To Dance_. 
Robbie Buchanan's synth programming at times echos Giorgio Moroder's synths in Limahl's _Neverending Story_, but there's just too much garbage 
swirling around it to salvage _Comin' Alive_.

After that unfortunate turn, the record kind of wimpers away. The synth brass in _You're Looking Like Love_ is fun but the song feels like a 
poor soundalike of much better material from the same record -- like _Maybe_!  Unfortunately _Can We Find Love Again_ is another mostly 
forgettable genre exercise.

That said, before giving it a chance, I assumed the whole record would be a series of forgettable genre exercises. There are some seriously 
great songs and breaks in here, with the standard content disclaimer for the over-the-top schlocky narrative premise.

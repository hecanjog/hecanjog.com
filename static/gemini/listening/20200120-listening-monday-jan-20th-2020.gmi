I’m excited that I’m finally dipping into this Lionel Marchetti boxset
that Sonoris put out a couple years ago. I loved their Jim O’Rourke and
Steve Roden box sets – functionally sturdy and nice-looking boxes too.
This one is partly a retrospective like the Roden box, including music
that goes back at least to the 90s like the track that kicks off disc
one. If someone had played me just the first track (Psychopompos) and
told me the subtitle for this disc was Inferno I’m not sure I would have
gone out of the way to listen to the rest – assuming I had no idea who
Marchetti was, at least… Psychopompos starts things off on a
surprisingly cheesy note with hokey ghost groaning sounds, scraped /
bowed cymbals, low thudding ritualistic drums and some shimmering that
could be the scraping of chains. Something I’d maybe expect from a high
quality Halloween theme CD. Play this on a loop at your entryway and
your house will feel very spoooooky!

Thankfully that’s where the cheeseball stops on this death-themed CD.
The rest of the disc consists of really top notch wordless audio plays
mixing field recording and spectacular concrete acousmatic sound shapes.
The final track (also called Inferno) explodes with teeming brass –
amazing-sounding unclean brass that growl fantastically against the edge
of the tape. Knowing Marchetti the brass is actually some scrap metal or
a broken pipe or something. I wish I could read French because there is
an extensive-looking booklet too, but the music very well speaks for
itself.

After being really surprised by a teenage Nathan Michel expertly
prefiguring his rock work 30 years later, today I checked out the most
recent project he has posted to his bandcamp page: a film score. It
looks like he’s been pretty focused on writing music for film and now I
understand why there hasn’t been much solo music released since The
Beast. His score for The Departure Variations doesn’t get nearly as
digital as his earlier solo laptop music and features a very
film-music-y instrumental world of pianos and strings and whatnot, but
this is probably the most beautiful stuff I’ve heard him write. It’s I
guess genre-ish, it has that film music idiomatic knowhow, but it’s not
at all bland or cookie-cutter in execution. The collection is short and
left me wanting more, I actually ended up playing it on a loop four or
five times this morning before I had to give it a rest. The electronics
work is really expertly subtle, reminds me a bit like Jóhann Jóhannsson
except overall much less stark and instead more lilting and soft. It’s
not a follow-up to The Beast but I hope he keeps sharing more of his
scores in collections like this.

Coming back to M.C. Schmidt’s (best known as 1/2 of Matmos) second solo
album still had me leaving happily overwhelmed. This one goes all over
the place without losing itself somehow. Moments of Return To Forever
style fusion, 50s electroacoustic music, landscapes of microsound
hypertextures… really impressive and very fun to listen to.

I picked up Seth Parker Woods’ asinglenoteisnotenough because it
includes a George Lewis piece. As a computer musician and onetime
trombonist, George Lewis is a personal hero. If I could play trombone
worth a damn, I wish I could play like him. His piece on this collection
is great and Woods makes you forget you’re listening to an album of solo
cello music. The whole album is timbre-city and all the pieces really
show off where he can take the cello. The final track written by Pierre
Alexandre Tremblay is the only one that really leans into
synthetic-sounding processing. The rest of the processing is derived
from the cello and stays tightly connected to it – the effect is more
like an extended cello (like Mario Davidovsky’s Synchronisms) than a
duet between electronics and cello.

Speaking of subtle processing, Wovenland’s processing seems to amount
entirely to simply alternating three recordings at a relatively fixed
interval. It has an amazing effect despite the extreme simplicity of the
approach. Some tracks combine Tsunoda and Unami’s field recordings by
layering with minimal if any editing once the environment has kicked off
– while others (which are probably the strands of the Wovenland title)
combine recordings vertically by alternating brutally hard digital cuts
at regular intervals from recording A to recording B or A and B and C,
etc so you have a sustained parade of evenly-lengthed fragments marching
ABABABABABAB until they start to mix in strange ways in your head.

This put me in the mind to hear some of Tsunoda’s retrospective box set
on ErstPast (an Erstwhile sub-label) and I ended up listening to all six
hours of it. He’s kind of known as the field recordist who puts mics in
weird places and comes back with other-worldly sounding field recording,
nothing at all like the sort of nature recording you’d find with most of
the acoustic ecology Chris Watson types for example. Tsunoda will stuff
a recorder and contact mic down a tube at a fish market near an idling
freighter and capture something that sounds like an understated Franciso
Lopez, or some minimalist computer music.

I think my new favorite track on the collection is track 10 on the final
disc where he went back to many of the places he took recordings of in
the 90s on the first few discs and tried to recreate them for the box
set reissue. Inside The Former Fish Market has a gorgeous sustained
choir-like drone resonating through some empty space that gets punctured
by a distant rattling bell that makes a perfectly consonant harmony.
It’s maybe the most “obvious” or immediately striking track of the
collection – possibly with the exception of the track where he claps
slowly in a huge tunnel which is the only track of its kind in the
entire box set – but it also pushes far enough into the realm of
“traditional music” to remind you how touched these recordings all are,
really. The booklet has a very detailed gear list and catalogs the type
of vibrations being recorded in what sort of location and so on very
carefully and it’s worth remembering that the music here is not just the
space, it’s really moreso the framing of the space.

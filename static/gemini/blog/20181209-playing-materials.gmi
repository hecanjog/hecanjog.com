## Playing Materials

Posted on 2018-12-9 20:00

When I started working on the original version of this project in 2011
it was going to be a book – I created the initial version of my pippi
computer music system to realize it. I figured I would need at least a
year to get somewhere, but seven years later the project has changed a
lot and I’m not in such a rush to get to the end anymore.

To be clear the initial idea had nothing to do with Pippi Longstocking
or any of Astrid Lindgren’s work. I was interested in making a
self-generating book, the contents of which would be a mixture of the
source code to produce the book, a story told in prose comments, (plus
simple tricks like naming progam entities after elements in the story
etc) commands to be typed into an accompanying sound-producing CLI
program, and line drawings. I recently found some notes I made about
that version which placed the code and prose comments on each left-side
page, additional narration, color-coded commands and line drawings on
each right-side page.

The story itself, the accompanying audio program, the line drawings were
all meant to be produced from a single seed-word. Editions would be
reproducable by simply hashing the input word and using the resulting
number as a seed for the random number generator.

I wanted to break the story into chapters, the first of which would
present each environment in the story minus the characters - this is the
way the Ramayana starts off. (Or so I’ve heard having only read the
great and short modern retelling by R.K. Narayan!)

In this version of the project, the experience was a solo venture. I was
thinking in part of playing old text-based adventure games via the
command interface, as well as the hybrid approach of the Broderbund
Carmen Sandiego games, which would come with a facts / world history
book that you were meant to consult during gameplay. But essentially the
idea at this point was you would sit down and read this book, typing
commands into the computer to signal shifts in the audio part, and
construct the immersive details in your mind, as you might when reading
any other story.

I never managed to work out a story, all my efforts went into adding
affordances to the software system and doing musical studies with it.
(That’s basically been the point to all the music I’ve made since 2011,
with a few exceptions.) But in the end it’s a hell of a thing to write a
good story, and I just couldn’t find my way into it. It’s much easier to
obsess over technical things than try to say something.

Anyway in this most recent study I decided I really needed to engage
with stories, and a way into it could be to start by studying and
retelling a story I liked – I like how the Ramayana has life in this
way, constantly being retold and reshaped. I read the Pippi Longstocking
stories as a kid, and their kindly fuck-you attitude was inspiring.
Pippi didn’t take any shit, did what she pleased grown-ups be damned,
and she was kind and thoughtful while she did it, so I’m going with that
for now.

I had the chance to do something in a non-traditional space, and I
thought I would give this new story-based study a shot finally. Because
of the built-in format (an audience arriving at the venue with zero
background on the project, and lots of expectations for what it means to
experience a “performance” in music) things started to change a lot in
the group context.

In this version there would be 4 laptops and 4 VOIP phones, plus one
laptop connected to a projecter and all of the smartphones that the
audience happened to bring with them – instead of a single laptop and a
book.

The laptops and the smartphones would display the scene corresponding to
the current place in the story, consisting of avatars, backgrounds, and
optional titles. Here’s the Pippi avatar:

Summary: Writing through personal musical practices then and now.
Status: draft


In 2011 I put my musicial life on hold with the intention of going into the 
workshop with a burning idea and coming out the other side transformed.

I didn't know what the other side would look like, and in the excitement of it 
all decided it would be best to announce the album I'd just finished as my last 
using the _He Can Jog_ name. _Norwood, Wisconsin_ felt at the time like the best 
articulation of that project I was capable of producing, and I was eager to move on.

Not just move on from the sound of whatever it was I'd decided was _my_ sound at the 
time (silly) but move into a new form of practice, finally engaging fully with ideas 
and approaches I'd only really let myself tinker on in the past: now they'd become 
center stage. A new chapter.

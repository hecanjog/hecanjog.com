Most of my listening today was checking out the new Healing Sound
Propagandist label out of Indiana. I’m not so interested in these genre
projects as a general rule, the catalog so far stays firmly in well-tred
territory somewhere between new age ambient, tone combination style
drone (though never really gets as static as that) and hints of bedroom
shoegaze. But of course that’s fine! I preferred Carlos Ferreira’s A
Glimpse of Hope maybe because of the bunch it’s the most static and
benefits as well from simply staying the course for about 51 minutes.
All of these releases are very pretty and well executed even if they
aren’t very… exciting or challenging. But not everything needs to be
exciting or challenging.

I haven’t listened to radio in quite a while but sampling the Organzied
Chaos show on aNONradio was fun. I wasn’t expecting a music show. It’s a
mixture of (bear with me while I get all these genres completely wrong)
speed gabber, mystical doom metal and a touch of breakcore. Not really
my usual fare but that’s what made it fun. Teeming with teen angst and
cheesy moves (glamish guitar solos in the metal, honky synth breakdowns
in the EDM) regardless of genre – but also possesed of some kind of
culture that I’m not a part of, and that usually gets my interest.
Overall fun, energetic.

As I write the next show – Intergalactic Wasabi Mix – just started with
a mix into Talking Head’s Burning Down The House. The DJ, snowdusk is on
the mic! They’re making quips about arson over the song! So I’m going to
stay tuned in for a while longer. I love indie radio.

The aNONradio project seems really cool – it’s an internet based
community radio station loosely organized around UNIX and free software
etc. I’m looking forward to sampling some of their other shows.

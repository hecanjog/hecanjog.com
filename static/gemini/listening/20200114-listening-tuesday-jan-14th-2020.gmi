Today was the yearly Richard D. James Album listen. Now that I’m
actually writing it all down, I kind of wonder in a few years if I’ll be
able to spot certain records like these that I think I’ve been playing
about once a year or so for 15 or 20 years and more. Curious to see if
that’s actually the case.

I’m also curious to see if eventually I’ll be able to see some listening
patterns for certain records, and maybe even make groups out of them.
Some records like 4Hero’s Two Pages when I put them on, sometimes they
keep coming back to the turntable on a daily basis for days until I
finally get it out of my system. That’s how I remember it feeling for
some things anyway, I wonder if that’ll be the case too.

I haven’t listened to this AWE record (full disclosure Andrew used some
of my bleeps and computer donks on it) in a long enough time that
listening felt really fresh again. I can see this also becoming one of
those yearly forever records…

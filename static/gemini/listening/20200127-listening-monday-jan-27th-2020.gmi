I think I listened to the Sunday
=> http://sparetire.radio.af Jazz Workshop
for more than 16 hours yesterday - I didn’t plan to but the playlist was
so good… Brent is going to start doing them every Sunday.

This Is How You Smile continues to grow on me.

I moved on to disc two of this Radio Canada comp from 1990 and there are
plenty more highlights – for me probably Marcelle Deschenes’
appropriately titled Big Bang II which is all explosions and cool
spectromorphology as well as David Jaeger’s Fancye organ feature are
some of the standouts. I also really enjoyed the rhythms and textures in
Diana McIntosh’s …and 8;30 in Newfoundland as well – according to
wikipedia she’s worked with Ann Southam who I need to get back into the
queue sometime soon!

This disc ends with a fantastic strumming string drone freakout from
James Montgomery called Saigon that also really stands out for me.

It’s sort of criminal this comp seems to have been erased from the earth
at some point. I stumbled onto it via soulseek – please, go and find it
there, this music deserves to be heard.

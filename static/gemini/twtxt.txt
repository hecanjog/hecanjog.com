2020-08-21T12:44:00-05:00	Testing first post...
2020-08-21T12:57:00-05:00	There are lots of cool clients and tools for twtxt... but I think I'd rather play with rolling my own given how simple the format is for everything. I suppose that's the point. :-)
2020-08-22T16:18:00-05:00	Might cobble together a little personal twtxt timeline today...
2020-08-22T16:58:00-05:00	It's extremely basic but I like that I could cobble together a twtxt feed reader so easily. I'd like better formatting & mention support, but it's something!
2020-08-22T17:06:00-05:00	I don't think I'll drop mastodon soon, but I love that I could "join" a social network so to speak by writing a few dozen lines of code.
2020-08-25T23:06:00-05:00	Slow day, slow week...
2020-08-26T19:32:00-05:00	Back to using an old netbook as a text terminal connected to my work computer so I can hide the big monitor and feel like I'm blocking out the world for a little bit...

2020-09-03T17:31:00-05:00	It's a bit comforting to post here. Even though it's in some sense extremely public, because barely anyone uses twtxt it feels a bit more like posting in a private journal. It would be nice to have mult-line posts, I suppose, but I can always start a clog. :-)
2020-09-03T17:33:00-05:00	I'm starting to doubt that I will ever finish Finnegans Wake, although I'm too stubborn to accept it yet. It's still fun to read aloud, and the language is beautiful, but it goes and goes and goes... anyway there's no rush to finish. I suppose I'll keep sipping from it as long as I like...
2020-09-03T17:36:00-05:00	@<https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> twtxt via DNS TXT would be insane and fun.
2020-09-05T23:46:00-05:00	Hm, I sorta want to re-read Foucault's Pendulum already.
2020-09-20T19:26:00-05:00	Capping off the evening with The Second Dream of the High-Tension Line Stepdown Transformer From the Four Dreams of China.

2020-09-28T21:58:00-05:00	I'm doing a thing that involves working with an external MIDI module (really, just another computer) for the first time in a long while. The realtime flow is weird, and makes want to set up some automated recording dealy so I can more easily fit everything into my usual workflow...
2020-09-28T22:50:00-05:00	Oh, OK that was actually really easy to set up. I can just run a MIDI playback script and end up with a local recording of an external module. Not super interesting but quite nice! :-)
2020-11-06T09:54:00-06:00	Before the pandemic hit in March, I'd spent the year without TV or movies. It didn't last through the lockdown, but I think I'm finally through a very long hump where I let myself melt into some distractions. I don't regret these periods, I like TV and movies, they're not only distractions, they can also be great storytellers. Still, it's good to finally feel like I need a break and I can take the time for other things again... I usually go in waves, pick it up, put it down, but this was a long one.
2020-11-06T10:02:00-06:00	At the same time I have to admit I've been more productive creatively this year than most years. I think that has more to do with Pippi getting fairly mature, enough at least that I need to spend far less time on Pippi itself, and far more time using it (and other things!) to make things.
2020-11-09T11:11:00-06:00	Got my personal blog a little further along last night... trying to decide if I want to weave this twtxt feed directly into my site, too, or leave it as a little secret corner of the web...
2020-11-09T13:36:00-06:00	Collaborative composition is tough. I think I tend to ruin things with ideas and plans. Lets hope I'm not doing it now!
2020-11-10T14:14:09-06:00	Whoops! Fixing the timestamps in my feed thanks to a hat tip from @<xandkar https://xandkar.net/twtxt.txt>
2020-11-11T12:03:39-06:00	@<xandkar https://xandkar.net/twtxt.txt> :thumbsup:
2020-11-11T12:03:57-06:00	2020 is all about yearning
2020-11-11T20:04:39-06:00	If there's a freshman 15, I think I've put on my pandemic 50.
2020-11-14T11:50:09-06:00	Think I'll make another batch of hemp muffins today...
2020-11-14T17:59:54-06:00	I think I want to get into curries this winter.
2020-11-15T09:45:48-06:00	OK, not too shabby. I just tried my first search with gemini and immediately found a delicious looking curry recipe. (Of course in beautiful plain text instead of 5 pages of ads and photos.)
2020-11-15T15:38:13-06:00	Hello gemini! gemini://hecanjog.com
2020-11-16T11:08:48-06:00	I've been making a daily ritual to run a fan and open the windows to circulate the air in my apartment. It's lovely, even in 20 degree weather -- I'm curious if I'll be able to do it when it's negative 20 too.
2020-11-16T12:05:13-06:00	I remember now why I stopped baking for a while. Because after I bake it, I eat it. Not as easy to dump most of my bakes off on friends during the pandemic, but I guess I'm going to try to drown my cousin in muffins so I don't eat em all.
2020-11-22T12:33:26-06:00	Looking at my firefox history, I made a list of the 21 sites I visit most often. Dreaming basically of pulling all the news-type sites into one static gemini page that updates every day... and seeing if there are CLI or other text-based alternatives for others. Some are hopeless -- like my bank's website... but I bet I could keep my web browser closed much more often if I put a little work into this...
2020-11-22T16:17:43-06:00	So little drive to do anything today... days like this I usually end up tinkering on my website though... I just banished my tablet to a box on a shelf (waiting to be given away) so that feels like something accomplished for the day, anyway...
2020-11-22T19:23:34-06:00	As predicted, I messed around with my site tonight. Maybe I'll do a bit more. It already feels really nice to be touchscreen-free. <3
2020-11-23T14:56:05-06:00	I'm checking my twtxt feed more often now that my stupid little client is pretty fast. More incentive to finish tinkering on my blog setup, maybe I'll write more. :-)
2020-12-04T15:02:16-06:00	I've been sick all week. Poor kitty hasn't played with his favorite toy all week (until today) and is currently giving me THE BUSINESS.
2020-12-06T15:48:55-06:00	@<pbatch https://pbat.ch/twtxt.txt> *waves*
2020-12-06T15:49:27-06:00	Today's task: travel two blocks to the grocery store. Today's accomplishments: some reading, playtime with cat, cat video watching with cat, petting cat.
2020-12-06T18:40:09-06:00	I did my one task for the day.
2020-12-11T13:22:08-06:00	Literally just got over some kind of bad cold and now I'm feeling round 2 approaching. This is pretty normal for me around this time, but it's a bit more stressful in plague times...
2020-12-12T23:08:03-06:00	Seriously considering hibernation for the winter... for me I think that might just mean outside of work put all deadlines and obligations on hold... try to get into the habit of spending most of my time just reading, maybe take up solitare? :-/
2020-12-12T23:10:15-06:00	It's in situations like that when I do my best work anyway...
2020-12-12T23:15:25-06:00	What is the feeling that makes this barrier every time I think of just doing these things I wish I could do all the time? Why is it that when I know I only have X number of hours until I need to return to some obligation, go back to work, etc that I feel unable to just exist as though those obligations aren't on the horizon? There is some kind of crisis of choice happening, maybe. When I took a week off from work earlier this year that all drained away after a couple days. I did all the things I dream of doing without feeling any anxiety about which I should choose first, or why I was doing this and not that. Is it possible to cultivate that feeling in the space of a few hours?
2020-12-12T23:21:34-06:00	On reflection, many of the projects that recently made me so overwhelmed that I put everything down for a while -- and down they've stayed mostly for more than a couple weeks at this point -- many of those projects were started or sparked somehow in the wake of that week off. For quite a while afterward even I kept that feeling of free exploration, and in the process knocked off a ton of things I'm still proud of now. Some kind of friction eventually caught up and pushed it all into the ground again though, and here I am totally unable to move the needle forward on anything outside of work. (And work has become tedious again...)
2020-12-12T23:26:14-06:00	Sorry for flooding your timelines, if anyone is actually reading this.
2020-12-24T01:10:14-06:00	For the latest, most up to date catalog listings. https://hecanjog.com/catalog.html
2020-12-24T15:04:39-06:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's a catalog containing a partial listing of all my commercial and non-commercial offerings: listed, unlisted, imagined, manufactured, found, constructed. Enhanced with insight from psionic druids where appropriate to tailor the experience just to you. (Some EU countries may prohibit this.)
2021-01-10T20:24:57-06:00	Kitty says: you're finally awake, lets play dummy!
2021-01-23T01:14:45-06:00	Movies and TV don't show people watching movies and TV much.
2021-01-26T09:31:22-06:00	I've been having recurring dreams where my band gets back together (in a tacitly post-covid world) and we just argue a lot. I guess at least I'm thinking about them. <3 (Also I just realized I've never once had a dream involving covid in any way. Weird.)
2021-01-26T09:35:33-06:00	Reading twtxt posts is so calming. I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed by mastodon sometimes actually. I check it too often, probably. Pipe dream: a personal daily digest of blog headlines, mastodon & twtxt posts emailed from my server every morning. I could potentially then... just check email once a day and fuck off all other forum / post / news refreshing for the rest of the day... I'd miss the interactive parts of mastodon maybe? Then again, I could just reply to everything once at day too...
2021-01-26T14:57:29-06:00	Passing thought: is there a connection between the rise of modular synthesis and the decline of people who know how to operate a general purpose computer?
2021-01-26T23:51:05-06:00	In retrospect, parsing / adopting RTs formally into the platform was probably the beginning of the end for twitter. It sort of set the stage for the future: gradual erasure of unique community tricks like the dot-prefix become broken by the open convention becoming regulated as a platform feature, not to mention paving the way for quote-retweets which many seem to think contribute to the current one-sided shout match culture twitter is experiencing... </random thoughts>
2021-01-28T13:24:33-06:00	Ahh Tetsu Inoue... where are you now? I'm playing some of his classic 90s hits today, like Slow and Low... #theStudio
2021-01-28T18:29:36-06:00	Ohhh... OK. So the difference between /usr/local/include and /usr/include is just that the former is for headers installed from source, and the latter is for headers installed by system packages? (Except it sounds like homebrew on macos just symlinks /usr/local/include to /usr/include?)
2021-02-01T18:32:42-06:00	I wonder if email would be a reasonable way to enable interaction on twtxt... something like publishing an email address for replies in the preamble of your feed, then like twtxt the rest is up to you, but I could imagine a simple moderation queue that could be checked periodically allowing the admin to move approved comments into some public space... I keep thinking I'll add activitypub comments to my site but it seems more complex than I care for. Ironically because of available tooling email actually feels simpler for this... of course, there is spam...
2021-02-01T18:39:17-06:00	It's also a shame that the twtxt spec didn't enforce post order from the start. It would make clients slightly more complex to build (barely) but then you could just stream line-by-line new updates instead of downloading every post in every feed...
2021-02-01T19:47:34-06:00	I deleted my account on a non-work slack server again... I hate it but it made me feel sad to login there. I don't know what it was. I like the people. Being too specific about what was posted that made me feel like that doesn't feel productive... but I finally admitted to myself I always came away from catching up with discussions feeling shitty about myself or the world, or something. So I did something about it, and now I'm venting about it here...
2021-02-06T10:31:40-06:00	I'm the oversleeping champion around these parts... says I to the nutso cat near me alternating between howls and a slow blink... I feel like I slept all day but I guess it's only 10-ish...
2021-02-13T06:06:59-06:00	A federated forum-like software based on read-only sqlite databases. Bring-your-own-client, like twtxt. That could be neat, maybe worth thinking beyond the headline idea... :)
2021-02-16T16:09:46-06:00	I just caught myself thinking a thought I'm sure I thought at work about 14 years ago. It was like being transported. I was back in that basement cube cursing the lack of strong typing in HTML forms... good time to get up and take a break. :)

2021-02-22T13:29:54-06:00	This internet thing is just a fad.
2021-02-22T14:17:26-06:00	Hm. I can't seem to view time.gov on textmode browsers I've tried. (just elinks & curl)
2021-02-23T13:16:56-06:00	I'm exploring the Cocteau Twins back catalog via two singles collections. Victorialand stands above all forever, but I'd like to hear more than the handful of EPs and misc I've encountered so far... surprising how much of an anomaly Victorialand is in their catalog, or so it seems...
2021-02-23T13:23:39-06:00	Testing twtxt to mastodon cross-posting... not sure if this is a good idea.
2021-02-25T12:50:01-06:00	STOP WORK NEVER WORK
2021-03-07T09:21:46-06:00	Starting a second job today picking up some hours on the weekend helping an old client with a new project... I was worried I'd feel overwhelmed right away but it's actually a bit fun to be able to start on something fresh that has the promise to last for weeks, maybe months, but then that's it.
2021-03-07T09:24:02-06:00	At some point today though I have an unscheduled play date with my nephew -- we're playing mario kart over the internet. I haven't played mario kart since it was on the nintendo 64 so this will be interesting!
2021-03-07T10:37:53-06:00	Is virtualbox kind of a pain in the ass to install or has it just been long enough that I forgot?
2021-03-07T12:33:41-06:00	I hope that with the new Apple ARM CPUs the current generation of mac-based generative art doesn't suffer the same fate it did in the transition from OS9 to OSX -- in other words: left to die except for those willing to maintain an OS emulator or possibly an ancient machine... but probably this is the fate of all mac and ios based software art...?
2021-03-08T10:43:06-06:00	I had a dream that I accidentally posted something on the fediverse during my IRL break from it. I used to have dreams like that when I quit smoking.
2021-03-08T11:32:32-06:00	My nephew this weekend after we spent a few minutes on the phone trying to debug an issue with discord audio chat: "I suppose I could just call you with my telephone when we play..."
2021-03-08T19:07:48-06:00	I'm completely incapable of taking notes or brainstorming at a computer. I just tried it again and failed... notecards it is again then.
2021-03-09T12:17:10-06:00	Blustery day.
2021-03-09T15:30:42-06:00	hell yes. https://scholar.archive.org/search?q=microsound
2021-03-09T15:32:59-06:00	Related: I didn't realize Kyma was originally written in smalltalk. The ACM paper linked in the scholar search above looks like an interesting read... "micro" for them in 1988 meant microcode...
2021-03-09T18:19:04-06:00	I can never remember the order of the potrace cli arguments for some reason.

2021-03-09T18:56:55-06:00	I'm curious if gemini will survive. Maybe that doesn't matter or is the wrong way to think about it...
2021-03-09T19:19:08-06:00	Someone just sent me a video they made for a song I did almost 20 years ago and it made me feel very happy.
2021-03-09T20:53:09-06:00	DNA lounge emails have a clever method to get you to open them... they always begin with a joke, so you can just see the setup in your inbox... and have to click in for the punchline. Effective!
2021-03-10T10:12:55-06:00	Communication in 2021 is surprisingly fucked. We've abandoned technologies that are totally fine (email, RSS, xmpp, even SMS and amazingly normal voice telephone calls..) for a mileau of closed bullshit platforms that don't interoperate. (slack, discord, iMessage, etc etc etc) This is not a novel observation but it drives me nuts.
2021-03-10T13:59:26-06:00	The new badges on the merveilles webring site are wonderfully useless fun. I'm looking forward to seeing more pop up & it's a nice choice to have them hosted remotely so I can keep tinkering on mine too. :-)
2021-03-10T15:04:50-06:00	I need to start thinking smaller, maybe. Short term. Now. Sometimes I live in the future too much, maybe.
2021-03-10T21:37:10-06:00	There aren't enough blankets in the world to smother me into sleep. ...but I'll take them all.
2021-03-11T08:54:17-06:00	Kitty discovered my little stash of TRS cables hanging by the desk. Well, now it's half a stash hanging by the desk and half spread over the floor or in his mouth.
2021-03-11T17:27:48-06:00	New life goal: play the rhodes part in the Bob James Taxi theme song with a Bob James cover band.
2021-03-17T13:02:23-05:00	We got a little snow the other day, but the forecast has been calling for it so much there must be someone nearby buried in it. For now my window is open and I can hear the drain flow as it melts back into the river...
2021-03-21T10:09:46-05:00	Doing a bit of MIR literature review today, catching up with what's happened in the last few years. (At least the stuff I'm interested in right now!) Essentia is tempting although huge. Still might be the best fit for our use-case...
2021-03-21T11:31:49-05:00	I'm ready for the social media era to be over now.
2021-03-22T14:36:19-05:00	Went to the river to forget the internet for a minute, but it's so nice out I'm having picnic table office hours for a while now too. <3
2021-03-27T17:53:59-05:00	Maybe I'll move to Alaska and become an unlicensed private investigator specializing in art and jewelry theft. 
2021-04-04T15:22:17-05:00	In life, triage is toughest.
2021-04-11T11:58:07-05:00	It probably looks cool to present some info on social media or a personal wiki or etc with zero context... I really wish people would cite their sources more often though...
2021-04-12T11:33:49-05:00	Now playing: David Grubbs - The Coxcomb. Hell of a record.
2021-04-12T11:38:18-05:00	@<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> agreed...! makes me think of the intro to Helmholtz' *On the Sensations of Tone* where he points out that the book presents his findings as though he'd taken a straight path to the clear road while the actual research process looked more like spinning in circles and getting lost in the woods... also thanks for the rainbow video link, looks interesting!
2021-04-12T11:58:21-05:00	Just discovered an unsaved vim buffer sitting in a local tmux session I forgot about for days now. Yikes. At least it was easy to remember where I left off. :)
2021-04-14T11:06:04-05:00	Idle thought: what if the way out of capitalism is just to destroy the social acceptance of normal fungable currency, not power structures or capitalism itself per se... The crypto craze actually might be the prelude to currency eating itself? Then what? Maybe instead of incentives based on wealth accumulation, society can find its way to more socially positive behavior, where debts are expressed in terms of your benifit to society in general... It's nice to think about, anyway.
2021-04-14T11:13:44-05:00	Maybe Satoshi was an anti-capitalist after all?
2021-04-16T14:02:42-05:00	I can see the sinewave of my own mood skimming through past twtxts...
2021-04-19T09:52:10-05:00	I like establishing routines more than keeping them I think.
2021-04-21T18:26:28-05:00	I don't know why I ever stopped growing wheatgrass for Louis. Sometimes I see his face light up as he remembers it and pops over to the windowsill to bury his face in sweet sweet grass. :)
2021-04-27T04:29:45-05:00	twtxt is still the only "social media" that doesn't actually feel like social media to me... maybe because in reality the damn thing is just a text file on my server. :-) <3
2021-04-27T05:47:08-05:00	Oh huh, I always thought the golden hour meant both sunrise and sunset, but I guess photographers usually call twilight the "blue hour" -- makes sense! Planning a little blue hour trip to a patch of lush forest by the river at the end of the week. :)
2021-04-28T16:28:48-05:00	I'm experimenting with just powering on my cable modem for three hours a day... once in the morning, once at the end of the work day, and once in the evening. So far it's a vast improvement.
2021-04-29T00:36:05-05:00	At some point between high school and college I had a kind of personal revelation that seems silly in retrospect. Until around then I'd considered the stuff I was doing on the computer with sound and the stuff I was doing with pencil and paper (scores my friends and I would perform) was the same. I'd kept them basically in their own corners -- there was the sound art type stuff and there was the pencil and paper composition stuff. Suddenly it clicked that these were the same thing -- it was all sound, all music... obvious as that sounds now it felt incredibly freeing. I think I'm experiencing the same moment now in considering my music work and my audio/visual/generative work as different threads... the walls are coming down and it all feels so obvious yet again in retrospect. :-)
2021-04-29T12:06:23-05:00	This experiment is really working out well so far. I feel like I have so much time in the day! I'm not doing this to be "more productive" but without constant distractions from the internet all day here I am at my lunch hour having already put in a full day's worth of work basically, and still I had plenty of time to go run errands, play with my cat, have a nice breakfast, study my topic de jour, etc. Always-on is bunk.
2021-04-29T16:39:04-05:00	lol race against the clock to perform a system update before the timer on my cable modem brings me back to blissful internet-free-land...
2021-04-30T07:38:57-05:00	After listening to pop music I feel like I need a shower. Like after a day at the beach.
2021-04-30T08:12:38-05:00	Experimenting with new fruit & veggie delivery methods. Today: 1 bushel of kale, 1/2c carrot juice, 1/2c carrot & orange juice mix, 1/2c greek yogurt, 1/2c coconut milk, 2c frozen mango & strawberries, 1 banana, 1tsp matcha powder, a sprinkle of chia seeds & hemp hearts... yum! It's too sweet for me though. Would be nice if it were a little thicker. Could use 2x kale and a bit less... maybe just cut the OJ? Dial back the coconut water? Strawberries too probably, but mostly because they make it all a sickly brown color haha. Oh and I forgot the ginger!!
2021-04-30T08:55:38-05:00	Yeah, the OJ is the problem taste in here. Next time no OJ, more kale & ginger!

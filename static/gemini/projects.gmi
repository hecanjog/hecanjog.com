## The Perfume-Eater from Sarvagandhasugandhā [2018] 

Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti set himself in such a concentration and
performed such a miraculous feat that those bodhisattvas and those great
disciples were enabled to see the universe called Sarvagandhasugandhā,
which is located in the direction of the zenith, beyond as many
buddhafields as there are sands in forty-two Ganges rivers. There the
tathāgata named Gandhottamakūta resides, lives, and is manifest. In that
universe, the trees emit a fragrance that far surpasses all the
fragrances, human and divine, of all the buddhafields of the ten
directions.

Christmas morning. I've done my best to synthesize my memories of Saint
Paul into something that conjures those same feelings for me."

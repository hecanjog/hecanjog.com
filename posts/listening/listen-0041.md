Summary: Angel Olsen, Altos


![Altos](/images/altos.jpg)

- [Angel Olsen – Half Way Home (2012 Bathetic)](https://www.discogs.com/Angel-Olsen-Half-Way-Home/master/645252)
- [Altos – Altos (2011 Self-released)](https://www.discogs.com/Altos-Altos/release/4836878)


On the subject of records I love yet are also the only record by that artist I've ever heard... Angel Olsen's _Half Way Home_ 
would fall into that category. I wonder sometimes if I'm almost afraid to ruin the magic of that one singular album by exploring 
the rest of the discography. But that's ridiculous, so I'll file Angel Olsen along with Silent Poets among those I need to catch up with. 
She's got [a split with Steve Gunn](https://www.discogs.com/Angel-Olsen-Steve-Gunn-Live-At-Pickathon-Angel-Olsen-Steve-Gunn/master/1141641), too -- probably a good place to start!

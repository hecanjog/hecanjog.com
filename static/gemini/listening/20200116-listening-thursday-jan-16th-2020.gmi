Some brief observations:

* On Hollerin’ The Spirit: this band really took shape – all the energy
and angst of Cap’n Jazz plus timbre for miles.

* On A Little Electronic Milky Way Of Sound: only six discs in and I’m
starting to think of this as a single piece in multiple variations. Not
looking forward to running out of discs.

* On Standing On A Hummingbird and Inland: Mark Templeton is one of the
great practitioners of 2nd or 3rd wave ambient/glitch or whatever you
want to call it. (1st wave french post-concrete 80s & 90s digital folks,
2nd wave bedroom laptop researchers like Fennesz, Opiate, etc?) I slept
on these in the day and they’re fantastic.

* On Five Points Fincastle: this was at the very top of my list circa
2004 and hasn’t aged a day since. I was there for the last kiss is still
so gorgeous.

* On Heritage: I can’t keep up! I think I’m about 30 hours behind on new
KFW and that’s just from the last few months. (I don’t really know how
many hours.) It’s honestly inspiring though. I’m in a similar place with
non-realtime generative projects and maybe I need to start releasing
them the way I listen to them myself – as sprawling lakes of undulating
process.

Update, the morning after: sometimes I publish these entries having just
put on the last thing for the day. I couldn’t make it through this new
KFW last night. I’ll have to try again when I’m in the right headspace.
I’m not totally sure the bandcamp data-dump is the right way to present
all this. I’m probably biased but I can’t help but feel like an internet
radio stream would be much better…

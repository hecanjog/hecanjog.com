My favorite record of the year so far, although we’re only about a week
in and it’s the only record I’ve listened to so far this year
(amazingly, to me) and it was released in 2018… but it’s really good.
Hard-to-describe and haunting guitar music that positions itself in a
dusty room and leaves more of the trail of sun hitting the particles in
the air near the guitar than the guitar itself in many moments. Makes me
think of the Recital label but this is more acousmatic and less
concerned with western classical music. (It’s still very much of the
world of western harmony to my ears, but fragmented and destructured
into sound-mass enough to be more than just chords and rhythms.)

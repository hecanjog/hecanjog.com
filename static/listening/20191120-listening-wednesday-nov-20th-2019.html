<p>Debussy’s <em>Etudes</em> three days straight! (Some days multiple listens)</p>
<p>It’s a great ear &amp; soul cleanser when you’re in the middle of writing something dense and long-winded…</p>
<p>I have two copies of this Greg Davis EP for no good reason – but it’s a nice one full of sharp space and acousmatic shapes. I suppose you could call it a collection of <em>play-sequences</em>: a term (apparantly coined by Guy Reibel) I’m borrowing from Annette Vande Gorne’s <em>Treatise on Writing Acousmatic Music on Fixed Media</em> and which I think means something along the lines of an intutive story told through the methods of energy-movement, morphology, space and color-spectra.</p>
<p>I really like Davis’ angular shape-music. He seemed much more interested in those sound worlds earlier on in his career, and for a while at least got more focused on space and tone with a number of tone combination and synth ambient type excursions. (Or so it seemed to me – I’ve missed a few of the newer ones &amp; look forward to catching up.) In any case his newest (<em>throughline</em>) seems like a marriage of the two (as long as I’m unfairly dumping everything he’s done into buckets) worlds: angular sound-shapes (mostly) frozen in space and time.</p>

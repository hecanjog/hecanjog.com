It might not be fair to say I actually listened to the Wayne Shorter and
Hank Mobley albums. The soundscape in my apartment on Saturday was more
a wash of screaming children and chattering adults as I hosted a
birthday party for my 94 year old grandmother. I stopped putting on
music after the Mobley when it was clear nobody would be able to hear
it! I am also regretting now that I didnâ€™t have my field recorder going.

Spent most of the day listening to something I’m working on, but took a
few listening breaks with Sun Ra and Christopher Hipgrave.

I really would love a new Christopher Hipgrave album! He’s been one of
my favorite computer musicians since his Home Normal debut Day blew me
out of the water.

Lanquidity gets further into the realm of funk than many Sun Ra albums,
but it’s still our man with his ways. Utopian, thoughtful and a bit more
funky than usual.

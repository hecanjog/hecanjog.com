## Listening - Monday, April 19th 2021

Posted on 2021-04-19 18:00

I’ve been struggling to decide what to listen to if anything recently
when I woke up this morning and hungrily pulled 15 albums from the
shelf.

I’ll list them here as I listen & see if I actually get through them all
today.

Feels nice to really feel stoked about putting something on the stereo
though!

### Sudden Hunger

Another playlist.

=> https://www.discogs.com/Various-5-Composers-ElectroAcoustic-Music-From-Sweden-1987-91/release/280044 Various – 5 Composers: ElectroAcoustic Music From Sweden 1987-91 (1993)

Delicious 80s tape music in the popular acousmatic style of the time.
Sadly the closing piece fell flat for me, but the rest of this
collection is a top notch tour through 80s tape music as it was being
practiced in Sweden at the time…

* 
=> https://www.discogs.com/R-Murray-Schafer-Loving/release/12644023 R. Murrary Schafer - Loving (2016)

Highly textual, I wish I spoke French. Superficially this doesn’t leap
out at me other than being an interesting piece of 60s new music… it has
many interesting moments of combination and transition. I think I like
the transitional moments the best. When things settle, they tend to
tread water aesthetically until the next gleaming shift… still, it’s way
more adventurous than most 60s art music and I think this wants a closer
listen with more background and context than I was able to give it. The
further into it I got, the more I enjoyed it. Past the idomatic 60s
tropes there seems to actually be lots of interesting things happening…
I still wish I could speak French.

=> https://www.discogs.com/Fuller-Korde-Dashow-DeLio-Williams-Neruda-Ashbery-Inman-Music-Text/release/5079820 Various - Music Text (1999)

Um, obviously also highly textual. :-) Most of the tracks on this are
settings of famous poems. As the cover says: Williams, Neruda… but also
there are some poems outside of the canon – the James Dashow and Thomas
DeLio settings use texts by John Ashbery and P. Inman respectively…

The Wesley Fuller tracks kicking off the comp are all settings of poems
by William Carlos Williams. This is.. just a classic style song cycle
for piano and baritone. I thought the harmony throughout was nicely
fluid and evocative, but these strike me as passable / nice idomatic
studies that don’t venture far from convention…

I hate to write the effort off without having taken the time to for
example study the relationship between the setting and the text, but
beyond some inventive lush moments in the piano part (and there are some
really nice piano moments) this just reads like a student work to me. In
other words: mostly just passable, going through the motions, highly
derivative.. maybe I’ve just heard too many student works in this style.

I’m now biding my time waiting on the Dashow which was the reason I
tracked this compilation down in the first place!

In the meantime though, Shirish Korde has a much more creative (IMHO)
ensemble offering in his Drowned Woman Of The Sky song cycle, which sets
text by Pablo Neruda.

The vocal writing is interesting (yay!) and the ensemble part ebbs and
flows along with the soprano… sorry Wesley Fuller but this is how you
write a compelling song cycle. :)

Well, now I’m at the end of my day – I’d saved the Dashow and DeLio for
last, but I think I hit my music saturation point for the day. That
didn’t take very long!

So I’ll pick up on this again in the morning, then.

Intermission…

Now, the Dashow!

… has led me
=> /research/ down a rabbit-hole
. It’s OK, I was expecting that.

To be continued…

Helado Negro’s This Is How You Smile keeps growing on me each listen. I
slept on it last year mostly, and I sometimes have a hard time finding a
way in to records which are to my ears a collection of individual
projects. Meaning, I guess: a singles collection with interstitial
tracks and transitions placed around each island of a song. That’s not a
dig, singles make economic sense now more than ever so it seems. Maybe
that doesn’t apply at all to this album, but for working musicians
fighting for stream counts it seems like a common tactic is to work
piece-by-piece, drip the release and try to maintain attention in an
oversaturated culture. Anyway the songs are so good, the production
reveals itself to be more nuanced every time I play it, and I mean who
cares if it’s a just a collection of good stuff and wasn’t composed as
one lilting stroke of sound in the old fashion. It’s a really strong
collection of songs and it’s my pleasure to find a way into hearing them
being a collection as such – which, I’m expecting to happen naturally
over further listens.

I realized recently I’d never heard the Pisaro & Stuart duo Ricefall
before – squidco had a sale, and now I’m a proud owner of a very loud
and present disc of amplified rice. The textures in this recording are
top notch computer music – except of course, they’re not at all. I
couldn’t help daydreaming of software implementations of these sounds
though – the entire thing is really sharp, detailed, microgestures
seething constantly under the surface as I guess you’d expect when
you’re dealing with hundreds of thousands of little percussive events!
I’d call it a top notch album of analog granular synthesis.

Milton Nascimento & Lô Borges’ Clube Da Esquina is still an epic,
gorgeous jaw-dropping classic. I can’t write about it yet.

Another cold listen of the day was the first disc of a compilation of
electroacoustic music from Canada. I grabbed it because I thought I
didn’t have the Dhomont piece on it (it turns out I do have it, but it’s
a really really excellent one) but I was excited to find the comp spans
decades from the 50s to the 90s and I’ve already got a few new names
I’ll need to explore further – like

whose … There Is A Way To Sing It… was one of the highlights of this
disc for me.

I also finally pulled this new Sukora album off the shelf for a proper
listen. It’s probably the best lowercase/silent album I’ve heard since I
popped my first Bernhard Günter CD into the player. There’s almost
nothing there, but there’s not nothing there either. Excursions like
this are wonderful excuses to do close listening to your current
environment, but the album managed to be almost not there and at the
same time create a framed experience for me that was more concrete than
just active listening. There are rumbles, there are whisps of distant
(high) tones and there are lots of little plops and ploops. It gave me
the impression of being in an empty cave, I imagined I was hearing the
slow drip from a stalactite forming. Each plop was an impulse tracing
the shape of the space being superimposed onto my apartment.

Next time, headphones.

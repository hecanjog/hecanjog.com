## Generating Stories

Posted on 2018-12-2 20:00

The most difficult part of this project so far has been trying to
reconcile my desire to keep the entire system fluid and surprising while
maintaining a coherent and compelling narrative.

What exactly constitutes a coherent narrative though?

Is this compelling? Is this coherent?

Is this compelling? Is this coherent?

Is this compelling? Is this coherent?

While these little stories may or may not feel coherent or be
compelling, they are all fixed. None of them have any fluidity on the
page – the worlds they might create are foregone, past-tense – they are
set. Read them again and there they are.

We could point to a degree of fluidity that’s always present in these
fixed narratives – especially good ones. A good story invites
re-reading, and the best always seem to offer up something new despite
their ultimate plasticity. Most good fixed-media pieces offer this: a
musical recording, a film, a TV show, a painting. We can come back to
the good stuff. Is that necessarily a quality of the work, or just as
much how we change and the way reading, listening viewing are creative
acts?

Generative works are another thing. The work emerges from the rules that
govern it, and those rules could change over time, or modify themselves.
A complex structure can emerge from incredibly simple rules. The
apparent structure itself can be modulated – rewritten – as simple rules
unfold and interact. Retelling a story is a fluid process, the common
thread from telling to telling comes from the underlying structure, and
the gamut of materials & material processes being worked with. The
elements of the story might stay the same, but the retelling can change
the story in fundamental and (satisfyingly) surprising ways.

Take this short render of one of the cues from South Seas as a simple
example. There is an apparent structure that emerges from this basic
rule-set: Given a sequence of events, the events are most likely short
(around a second or less) but there is a small chance the event will be
long (several seconds or more) – and the next event always begins around
halfway through the length of the current event. It’s almost nothing, as
far as algorithms go, but it creates a simple phrasing that adds a
palatable structure to what would otherwise sound like a monotonous
stream of events. It creates a little story, clustering the events into
phrases and adding a breath which acts like the consequent of a
call-and-response for each phrase. Suddenly out of almost nothing,
there’s a little story being told.

Here’s another short render, the only change to the cue script being
that the lengths of each event are uniform and much longer. All of the
details are different, but the difference we really hear is in that tiny
tweak to the pacing of events. This is a simple example but this sort of
simple modulation of structure can be incredibly effective, and
completely change the way something feels. You could say it tells a
different story with the same characters, the same locations etc.

And finally just for comparison, here’s another render using the same
event length calculations from the original, but discarding the long
events for a uniform set of short events. It has a kind of plodding,
relentless feeling that the others don’t have.

Coherency emerges from the structure in part as well as from the act of
listening – sound has a capacity for the superposition of coherency that
I think language just can’t support. Basically it’s much easier to roll
the dice with sound without arriving at incoherent mush. Almost any
structure imposed on the sound gets promoted to narrative. This is a
beautiful thing, and one of the most compelling reasons for working with
generative processes in my opinion. It’s much more of a straightforward
process to erase yourself from the whole thing – let the process
recompose the story in surprising ways, to take on a life of its own
without having to coax it here or there. The whole process feels
playful.

So how do you generate a coherent story? Lets take a couple famous
examples of generative story-telling. Look at madlibs – the approach is
to use the grammar of a sentence as a structure to find spots for
erasure. You scramble up the particulars: names, places, descriptive
modifiers within an otherwise simple & coherent framework. Even this
process erodes coherency – the simplest story can become totally absurd
just by shuffling these static elements around. The process actually
relies on the erosion of coherency – that’s why the result is funny.
That’s what makes it fun.

Another famous example that comes to mind are the “choose your own
adventure” stories I grew up with. These aren’t really generative
stories though – they’re multiple fixed stories, a series of
pre-determined alternate paths. Once you take every path, the potential
for variation is completely consumed. There isn’t any real affordance of
agency here, just a set of fixed variations that lead to a finite number
of linear stories. They’re just a compressed way of writing out several
variations of a story, not a real platform for fluid storytelling.
Still, that’s not to say they aren’t fun, but they don’t have the
endless potential of even a madlibs approach, although they maintain
coherency by lacking true freedom in variation.

Video games seem to take a sort of hybrid approach. There is the total
freedom of navigating in an open world, but stories are always told in a
choose your own adventure style. There are a fixed number of
predetermined narrative paths that can be explored. They may be far more
numerous than the traditional choose your own adventure, but there’s
still always the hand-off moment where the fixed story takes over – you
have the agency to choose when you experience each part of it, and which
part of which story you might want to participate in, but the story
itself unfolds in a goal-oriented choose your own adventure style. Open
this door and you get eaten by the bear! Open the other door and you
find a great treasure! That said, I have extremely limited experience
with games and I suspect there are much more creative approaches to
storytelling in practice out there.

My working theory at the moment is that the success of a generative
story lies somewhere in its capacity for interaction – that is, the
observer-participant needs real agency for it to have freedom and
fluidity without totally destroying coherency (This almost comes for
free with a piece of generative music.)

I keep coming back to the dynamic I remember from my middle school days
of playing Dungeons and Dragons. The dungeon-master isn’t really there
to tell you a story, their primary role is to facilitate the agency of
the players, and to illustrate the (dice-roll-driven but also
pre-composed in part) reactions of the story-world to their decisions.
This feels like an appropriate role for a story-telling-system that
doesn’t want to dictate the story per se, but create the potential for a
story – which is ultimately constructed in its reading through the
choices and observations of its readers.

This all sort of begs the question: why not just let the story become
incoherent? Why not embrace the incoherency and drop the mitigating
strategies – isn’t that in the end, freer? More fluid? My feeling is
that allowing incoherency to bloom is a valid strategy, but just a
strategy, not really a workable approach in general. If you throw away
all the signposts of structure and self-logic then that lack of
structure eventually becomes the foremost element, and you’re left with
a set of endless variations that amount to the feeling of a single
state: incoherence. This is a useful place to visit – something like
Stockhausen’s listening to “the beauty as it flies” – living entirely in
the moment, almost static in its constant change. A useful place to
visit, and re-visit, but just one potential form in a universe of
possible forms.

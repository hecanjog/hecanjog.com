## Real Time Pitch Tracking

Posted on 2021-05-23 12:00

## Notes

### Yin

I’m a long-time Yin user, but the algorithm seems to have some serious
limitations for realtime use in an embedded enviroment:

* The algorithm is block-based and inherently latent

* The fast version of the algorithm requires an FFT on every block

* In my experiments the algorthm slows to a crawl with a large tau_max,
so detecting pitches lower than ~70-80hz seems to have a pretty big
impact on performance.

### Extended Complex Kalman Filter

Das Orchisama, Chris Chafe and JOS to the rescue maybe?

* This algorithm is designed for low-latency real time use, and computes
a pitch estimate on every sample instead of every frame like Yin.

* It still requires an FFT on every block, although there is a note
about some mitigations in the paper…

* Seems to perform much better than Yin: much more stable and tracks
fast moment more easily

### Bell Labs Hardware Implementation

=> https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1162765 1976 IEEE paper: J Dubnowski, R Schafer, L Rabiner. Real-time digital hardware pitch detector

Is this something? They call this “high-quality” but that’s in 1976.
Maybe it’s just a basic autocorrelation approach? (EG what Yin attempts
to improve on…)

I’ll have to track down access, I’m curious…

### MPM / Tartini

* The “clarity” param is interesting.

* Also requires an FFT.

* Is optimized to use small block sizes though, so latency should be
lower… but then you’re doing that many more FFTs a second…

<p><em>Impossible Grey</em> is one of Günter’s more silent pieces – maybe the most silent. Despite his suggestion to play these earlier albums quietly, I do tend to crank them up to at least the point where they are not losing a battle when the A/C kicks on in my apartment. This EP-length offering has something like a dozen or so audible events during its 18 minutes. Something like this which is often gone and only at its most pronounced barely there maybe seems like a prank, or pretentious, or some other sort of put-on. The truth is the modesty of its offering is a little overwhelming. There are so few gestures offered up into your listening environment – this isn’t just a 4’33" type exercise in activated listening to the environment, although that’s certainly a happy side effect. If I could imagine an analog to this album it would be a transparent overlay on a window, with gem-like points that gently disturb the light passing through, creating an observable pattern that sits inside the frame of the window rather than on top of it.</p>
<p>If the appeal is just some incidental dirt smeared on a window, what exactly is the composer bringing to this? How could it have value if it could be pumped out in bulk by a child? Without becoming too obsessed with ego and intention, the fact is every choice in a hyper-restrained piece like this is a jewel. It’s not important if each gesture was labored over or chosen freely and easily, each one is a micro-composition placed inside the listening environment – just an offering as time passes, a tiny situation that’s gone as quickly as it arrives and rewards patient and thoughtful listening.</p>
<p><em>Monochrome Rust / Differential</em> and its companion set <em>Monochrome White / Polychrome with Neon Nails</em> along with the otherwise unrelated <em>音丈 (Oto Dake)</em> for me are a suite of ghost drones. These albums are to my ears very different from the rest of his work although the Line double-discs all operate at the edge of perception which was a recurring theme in his earlier music. Much of Günter’s music, especially the early stuff, is very gesture-oriented. Points and events placed in space, gestures that articulate themselves once and never return. They’re story-tellers without a narrative per se.</p>
<p>This trio of ghost drone albums all create a continuous environment for their duration. The Line discs sparkle and crackle and seethe with detail – even more so I listen to these albums <em>loud</em> so as to feel like I’m inside this world, surrounded by the cellophane echos of that mysterious Immedia disc. <em>Monochrome White / Polychrome with Neon Nails</em> was constructed from a nearly-silent disc called <em>In Audio</em>.</p>
<p>I don’t know much of anything about Immedia except that in 1998/1999 they released this disc which captivated Günter enough for him to do two double-disc reworkings of its near-silent material. The second double-disc <em>Monochrome Rust / Differential</em> uses the first as its sound source, and in theory the process could continue forever.</p>
<p>It didn’t though, so I’m content to crank these double albums now and then and climb into their plastic gauzy sheen for a while.</p>
<p>I felt a little badly writing that basically all recent Another Timbre albums sound the same a few posts ago. That’s not nearly fair. Simon Reynell has a very specific vision and appetite which has changed over the years and currently seems to be settled somewhere in the world of very understated chamber music. I have tended to listen to batches of these releases in one day, fairly casually, and so they blend together from inattention because they’re basically all simpatico, but I shouldn’t suggest that recent releases on the label are just a parade of the same thing. That absolutely happens with some genre labels and Another Timbre is not one of those.</p>
<p><em>During a Lifetime</em> could easily be mistaken for an album of additive synthesis at times. The composer is a saxophonist and the opening track for saxophone ensemble is obviously written with a knowledge of the instrument. The later pieces feature members of Apartment House and introduce new timbres like strings and accordion and flute and even percussion, but each explores a similar smearing world of tone combination from a different angle. There are precious few events as such here but it’s not really a drone album either. Like most of the new Another Timbre stuff it’s very very pretty, but this stands out in its blurry arrangements and lack of overt patterns.</p>

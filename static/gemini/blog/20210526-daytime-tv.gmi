## Daytime TV

Posted on 2021-05-26 17:20

I was telling J about this idea I heard Clay Shirkey describe that’s
stuck with me for years. In the early days of the smartphone, he and
<Name!?> were trying to make sense of this weird new world we’d stepped
into. In one of his talks Shirkey compared the current moment where
“social media” was becoming a cohesive idea you could talk about in a
distinct way from the rest of the internet, and more importantaly we
were just starting to get drunk on it as a culture.

That was his idea, basically: that you could point to a time in cultural
history when we were drunk on TV, but we’d figured out how to live with
it eventually. As I remember it, this was meant to be a gleam of hope in
the social media cave we were currently climbing deeper into.

J’s immediate reaction was “we’re still drunk on TV” which made me
think. It’s absolutely right: just look at the never ending procession
of garbage programming, straight from the reality TV era to our new
streaming lifestyles without missing a beat. TV drunkness has reached
new heights with “binge watching” being essentially a normal thing.
We’re drunk on TV too.

The transition I wanted to acknowledge with Shirkey’s idea that we were
once drunk on TV, but had learned to deal with had already passed and I
didn’t even realize it. At least that’s the basic idea behind this
little blog post: daytime TV is gone, but I think I see the glimmer of
hope that it will return.

Why the hell should it? Daytime TV is (was?) basically an in-a-word way
to describe bad TV. It’s what you subjected yourself to on shitty days
when you were home sick or just sick of the world. It was associated
with pulp entertainment and tabloid journalism. The one sort of
acceptable guilty pleasure someone might actually admit to was watching
soap operas: “I like my stories” was a common enough phrase to become a
trope of sorts.

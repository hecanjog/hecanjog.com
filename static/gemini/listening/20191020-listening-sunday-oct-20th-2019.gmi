Sometimes I wonder how well known this Silent Poets album is in the US –
I think it made a splash in the late 90s / early 00s? It did for me. I
found it in a record store in Chicago recommended to me because I was
buying Nobukazu Takemura’s Child & Magic album with obvious excitement.

The collaborations with the all-female rap group

short but stark and unforgettable cameo are still the album’s highlights
for me. I have made a minor hobby of tracking down all the many
alternate mixes and versions out there – prisons especially has some
inspired alter-egos.

Over the years the straight instrumental dub and saccharine pop songs in
between have grown on me quite a lot though. Funny that it’s one of my
favorite records of the era, I’ve heard almost every version and remix
(there are a lot of them) but I still haven’t listened to any other
Silent Poets albums! Something to look forward to.

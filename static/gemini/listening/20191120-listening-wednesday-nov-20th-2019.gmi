Debussy’s Etudes three days straight! (Some days multiple listens)

It’s a great ear & soul cleanser when you’re in the middle of writing
something dense and long-winded…

I have two copies of this Greg Davis EP for no good reason – but it’s a
nice one full of sharp space and acousmatic shapes. I suppose you could
call it a collection of play-sequences: a term (apparantly coined by Guy
Reibel) I’m borrowing from Annette Vande Gorne’s Treatise on Writing
Acousmatic Music on Fixed Media and which I think means something along
the lines of an intutive story told through the methods of
energy-movement, morphology, space and color-spectra.

I really like Davis’ angular shape-music. He seemed much more interested
in those sound worlds earlier on in his career, and for a while at least
got more focused on space and tone with a number of tone combination and
synth ambient type excursions. (Or so it seemed to me – I’ve missed a
few of the newer ones & look forward to catching up.) In any case his
newest (throughline) seems like a marriage of the two (as long as I’m
unfairly dumping everything he’s done into buckets) worlds: angular
sound-shapes (mostly) frozen in space and time.

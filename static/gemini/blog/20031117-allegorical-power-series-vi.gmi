## Allegorical Power Series VI
Posted on 2003-11-17 23:44

Since June 2003 Antiopic records has been publishing a series of monthly
mp3 compilations intended to provoke a socially conscious dialog through
“abstract or experimental art and music” - discussion of which they
consider to be too often limited to matters of aesthetics. Some of the
most creative talents in new music have contributed mp3s (and in one
case a quicktime movie) to what is turning into some of the most
consistetly high-caliber online releases around to date - on par
certainly with the likes of Fallt’s popular invalidObject series.
November’s chapter is smaller than previous releases and unfortunately
contains some weaker material than has been presented before. Even so,
Volume VI has many high points - such as duul_drv’s moving combination
of drones and a field recording of an arrest under words, there is
something hidden, as well as Julien Ottavi and Dion Workman’s beautiful
Beginning Again, Desist’s lovely and understated Untitled, and We’re
Breaking Up’s well balanced microsound collage of radio static Receiver
1. The two remaining contributions from Presocratics and Lovely Midget
aren’t failures by any means - they’re simply overshadowed by the
strengths of the other releases, not to mention the incredible
back-catalog (all of which is still availible for download) of the
previous volumes in the series. Not every piece of music immediately
inspires a socially informed critique, and certainly none is simply an
exercise in propaganda - but the very act of enclosing these works in
the casing of a suggestion to mindful political consideration gives them
another dimension to be unraveled. It’s usually a fun and sometimes
challenging task that tends to inform the possible aesthetic readings of
the works rather than negating them. Highly recommended.

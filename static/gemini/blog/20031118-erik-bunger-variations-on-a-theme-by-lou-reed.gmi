## Erik Bünger - Variations on a Theme by Lou Reed
Posted on 2003-11-18 15:22

When

I

found

Erik

Bünger’s

Variations

on

a

Theme

by

Lou

Reed

at

iDEAL

Recordings

I

had

never

heard

of

him

-

I

loved

the

recording,

so

the

next

day

(today)

I

decided

to

try

to

find

a

little

more

out

about

him.

A

quick

google

search

first

revealed

that

he

was

a

member

of

both

Cycling

74

’s

Max/MSP

mailing

list

as

well

as

the

Yahoo!

based

plunderphonia

mailing

list

dedicated

to

the

discussion

of

John

Oswald

and

other

plunderphonics

related

subjects.

These

pieces

of

information

fit

nicely

into

the

puzzle

I

had

already

been

presented.

Variations

on

a

Theme

by

Lou

Reed

is

-

technically

speaking

-

simply

a

gradual

granular

deconstruction

and

time-stretching

of

an

enchanting

loop

from

The

Velvet

Underground

&

Nico’s

famous

Verve

album

produced

by

Andy

Warhol.

Bünger

chooses

a

sublime

moment

with

chiming

guitars

and

Lou

Reed

passionately

crooning

the

word

heroin.

Already

he’s

set

up

a

situation

pregnant

with

possible

meaning.

Is

he

doing

violence

to

Lou

Reed’s

passion

for

heroin?

The

glam-rock

and

drug-soaked

lifestyle

both

Reed

and

Warhol

led?

Or

is

the

fracturing

of

Reed’s

voice

and

guitars

a

method

of

zooming

in

past

the

surface

of

meaning

to

raw

aesthetics

&

skittering

molecules

of

sound

-

maybe

Bünger

is

attempting

to

get

past

the

rock

and

roll,

sex

and

drugs

casing

of

Reed’s

music

to

the

sounds

themselves.

Is

he

liberating

Reed’s

own

music

from

himself?

Bünger

manages

to

engage

this

dialog

in

the

simplest

of

possible

methods.

He

simply

slows

the

sample

(pitch

intact)

down.

The

end

result

is

a

shattered

and

stuttering

sitar-like

drone,

with

the

individual

phonemes

in

Reed’s

voice

stretched

into

a

sort

of

raga.

Further

digging

reveals

records

of

several

solo

and

ensemble

performances

as

well

as

affiliation

with

a

Swedish

arts

collective

called

The

Nursery.

A

realaudio

recording

of

a

February

performance

of

the

Erik

Bünger

ensemble,

where

the

group

deconstructs

the

sounds

and

images

of

instrument

instruction

tapes

from

the

80s

and

reforms

them

into

a

virtuosic

improvised

set

of

laptop-powered

joystick

wiggling

is

paried

with

a

few

words

that

I

can

only

assume

Bünger

has

penned:

* For me it’s all about revenge, to take control over those who have
controlled me. Those people who think control is the first criteria on
musical ability lose the control in our hands. I’ll leave this review on
that positive note - it’s refreshing to see someone who clearly has a
virtuosic control of his technique acknowledge the hollowness of it.
http://www.idealrecordings.com/iDEAL/mp3show_04.gmi Update: Bünger has
a new project online for the Swedish Radio called “let them sing it for
you.” It’s an “interactive, ever-growing sound art project” which lets
you enter text into a flash interface that plays the text back using
plundered clips from pop songs. It’s never been more fun to
reappropriate the plastic, commercial history of pop music for your own
personal creativity. :-) Here’s the link.

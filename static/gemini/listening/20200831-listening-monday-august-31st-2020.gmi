[We Have Amnesia Sometimes]

I stopped writing in this listening journal back in February. Of course
I kept listening, but at some point the idea of trying to write about
everything I listen to started to weigh poorly on my listening choices.
I don’t need to write about everything I listen to, so I won’t.

Going forward I’ll just write something here when it feels like fun. Not
because I have anything special to say per se, or because the things I
listen to have some special weight but just because I feel like writing
a little bit. I felt like writing a little bit today. :-)

I also haven’t been listening to very much music for the past few weeks
– the happy exception being the new routine of Sunday listening club
meetings with a small group of friends.

Most of this new Yo La Tengo album has been sitting on my hard drive
unplayed for quite a while. Between the time I picked up three of the
tracks on bandcamp and now they’ve collated it into an album and even
pressed an LP. So, I accidentally listened to two tracks out of order
before I realized there were more, and everything had been collected.

I’ve heard very little of Yo La Tengo’s music. In high school, their and
then nothing turned itself inside out record was coveted by friends, and
I did spend some time with it because of their enthusiasm. Last year, I
picked up a dirt cheap copy of it on discogs curious to revisit – and
honestly I’ll have to spend more time with it to feel like I have
anything to say. It still didn’t really hit me in a particular way, but
I remember it as a nice album anyway.

I was curious about these tracks now called We Have Amnesia Sometimes
partly because I’d like to give this band another chance, partly because
Marc Weidenbaum wrote something nice about one of them, partly because I
wanted to see what had or hadn’t changed in the 20 years since nothing
turned itself inside out, but mostly because these songs are all just
recordings from improvisations / jams during their normal rehearsals. I
was aware of their reputation as improvisers and being a rock band I
assume they get into the psych/jam band territory as improvisers which
is something I generally enjoy even from groups that aren’t the most
skillful improvisers, whatever that means.

Based on the titles (and from what I remember of the pace of the
releases on bandcamp when they were coming out as singles) I think each
track is a curated moment from some part of that day’s rehearsal, one
for each day of the week Monday through Friday. If I had to pick a
favorite, Wednesday’s James Gets Up And Watches Mourning Birds With
Abraham has a nice Arnold Dreyblatt drive to it and feels maybe the most
composed of the bunch. On the whole though all of these tracks follow
essentially the same pattern which is well-worn by jam bands of all
walks: settle into a droning groove & do a bit of solo work on top. The
lone exception being the final track which is mostly drum-free, but
otherwise essentially follows the same pattern. Nothing on this album
jumps out at me to validate the praise I’ve heard about their skill for
improvisation, but that’s not to say the songs don’t hang together or
that it sounds like they aren’t listening to each other, etc. For me
these are best listened to not as improvisations really but just as what
they are: a rock band nicely screwing around in their rehearsal space.
(And the louder I play these, the better they sound – probably the best
listening experience would be on a mono PA system cranked up at least
enough to match the volume of a rock drummer in a mid-sized room.) To be
honest I might enjoy these more if they were all three or four times as
long and had enough time to actually sprawl out into the meditative jam
zones they tease.

Thankfully they had the good sense to stop after a week’s worth of
recording though. This is a nice snapshot in time, and I think I’ll come
back to it next time I feel like playing their music, but it would
quickly fall over on itself as a never-ending series. I don’t really
feel like there are any tracks on here that stand out as something
extremely special, but that’s also the charm of the collection. I’d like
to hear documents like this in the future from them, but let some time
pass. Yo La Tengo, are you listening? ;-) It could be a nice yearly
event to set down these relaxed interstitial moments in the workshop.
This window into their rehearsal space is fun and pleasant in a way that
a highly polished worked-over studio album could never be.

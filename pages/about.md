## Community Projects

### [Pippi / libpippi](https://pippi.world)

I'm slowly getting a web radio project off the ground with some friends. 
[Aleatoric Forest](https://radio.af) is streaming several channels of ... ?!?! ... right now.

### [LuvSound](https://luvsound.org)

I started LuvSound in 2004 as a netlabel in the heyday of what we all kinda thought was going to be this 
post-capitalist moment of shifting the means of production into the hands of the common person... anyway 
now we have facebook and other bullshit, and distributing free music on the web is tainted by the poison 
of streaming platforms and everything-as-a-service-life...

The [music is still the point though.](https://luvsound.org)

I have some plans for LuvSound, but it's been essentially in maintenance mode for a number of years now.

### [Driftless Audio](https://driftless.audio)

This is a new home for collaborative software projects. We're cooking up something fun one weekend at a time.

### [WFMU](https://wfmu.org)

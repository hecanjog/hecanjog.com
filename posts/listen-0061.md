It might not be fair to say I actually _listened_ to the Wayne Shorter and Hank Mobley albums. The soundscape in my apartment on Saturday was more a wash of screaming children and chattering 
adults as I hosted a birthday party for my 94 year old grandmother. I stopped putting on music after the Mobley when it was clear nobody would be able to hear it! I am also regretting now that I 
didn't have my field recorder going.

Spent most of the day listening to something I'm working on, but took a few listening breaks with Sun Ra and Christopher Hipgrave.

I really would love a new Christopher Hipgrave album! He's been one of my favorite computer musicians since his Home Normal debut _Day_ blew 
me out of the water.

_Lanquidity_ gets further into the realm of funk than many Sun Ra albums, but it's still our man with his ways. Utopian, thoughtful and a bit 
more funky than usual.

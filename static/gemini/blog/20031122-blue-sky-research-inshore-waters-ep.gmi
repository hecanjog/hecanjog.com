## Blue Sky Research - Inshore Waters EP
Posted on 2003-11-22 3:22

Jonathan Fisher - also known as Blue Sky Research and the admin of
Hippocamp.net, a Manchester England based netlabel - has taken a slight
departure on Inshore Waters from his previous beat driven synth
pastorals. The very brief EP - it clocks in at under ten minutes with
four tracks - was inspired by the “changing weather” he encountered on a
trip to the English coast. The pieces are steeped in gentle acoustic
guitar sound-phantoms alongside touches of harmonica, a disaffected
weather forcast, and sounds of the coast.
The album’s opener, Firth of Tay, glides in with the ease of an Ahmad
Szabo or Apollo-era Brian Eno - tactfully coaxing the character of a
windchime from delay-drenched guitar and harmonica samples and then
gliding as effortlessly back into the misty silences it casually
shuffled from in just over 60 seconds. This, and the two closing pieces
- Firth of Tay Forcast (which draws on just the guitar sounds from the
opening piece) and North Foreland (a distant reverberation of sitar-like
harmonica and the sighing crashing of waves) - offer themselves as
fleeting textural Haiku. Each briefly explores the particular cadences
of a chosen set of sounds much as the eye might passingly move from rock
to rock and crest to crest in viewing a scene like the one depicted in
the album’s accompanying photograph. Bristol Channel, however, settles
down for a few moments to take in the entire scene. Plucked guitar tones
ebb like rolling waves around a subtle drone melody one might expect to
be trumpeted from the blowhole of an Atlantic-dwelling whale who had
done a bit of study in Buddhism and the pronouncement of “Om.”
Rhodes-like guitars eventually chime gentle harmonic patterns over top
until slipping away again a minute later and leaving only the swiftly
retreating decay of muted guitar. Like Szabo’s This Book is About Words
Fisher’s Inshore Waters fragments warm samples of acoustic guitar into
ambient chamber works - but Fisher doesn’t make his edits hard. The
allure of the glitch is sacrificed for small moments that bleed
seamlessly into each other. DSP is largely ignored for the simple
transformations of delay, reverse, and reverb - and the guitar is left
to its natural texture.
This EP is a lovely aural snapshot of a pleasant trip not far from home,
handed discreetly to the listener for an impressionistic recap of the
journey. http://www.hippocamp.net/1003/15.asp (hippocamp is currently
moving its mp3 archives to another server - the album is down at time of
writing, but should be back up soon if Jon gets scene.org to host the
files. it’s worth the wait.)

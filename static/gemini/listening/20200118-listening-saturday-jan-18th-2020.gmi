I’m really behind on my Kenneth Kirschner listening, I may never catch
up… as much as the no-metadata approach to dumping new works quietly and
formlessly is aesthetically appealing, in practice it means I’m probably
only going to dip in randomly. In recent years his music seems mainly
written for traditional instrumentation. Maybe at least include a list
of forces to jog memory when perusing decades of music without any
context except the completion date? It would help to find some of the
older stuff I remember being much more timbrally various and percussive…
Anyway, archival practices aside, I’ve heard the Feldman-esque vibe in
previous material but April 17, 2019 is very much leaning into that
world. It would sit happily among the recent releases on Another Timbre.
I like Another Timbre very much, but like any label that has a fairly
hyper-focused eye on a very specific sound, the material can really
blend together into a forgettable mush sometimes. Which of these CDs of
chamber music performed by Apartment House was I just listening to? I
don’t like how easy one solo piano and violin piece with a pleasant
harmony and plenty of space between events blends with the other, but
they eventually become interchangeable with enough entries.

So the Kirschner will get filed (mentally) along with a stack of lovely
CDs that I’ll play at random when I’m feeling like hearing that late
2010s Another Timbre sound again.

I guess I’m catching up today with a few releases I picked up last year
for this reason or that by artists that are new or mostly unfamiliar to
me. I know I’ve seen Joda Clément’s name in the Glistening Examples
catalog but I don’t remember what drew me to pick up this 2015 album on
Notice. It’s very understated and nice – a good wipe of the slate after
the relative disappointment of the Kirschner. It reminded me of the
space in some of Brent Gutzeit’s recent albums, and even a bit of the
wide understatement of Sukora’s Ice Cream Day! Nice Day! though much
less extreme.

Marc Hasselbalch’s Exact Impo and levinson / mahlmeister’s 10-27-19 were
both found via the
=> llllllll.co lines
forum. I’d heard Exact Impo a couple times already and a repeat listen
was very welcome. Some gorgeous and patient work with a single function
generator.

I really enjoyed 10-27-19 as well – if memory serves this EP is an edit
from a series of improvisations, which is a recipe I usually enjoy.
Overall the music is much more active and playful than anything else
above but still sits nicely on the edge of the realm of atmosphere.

This recent brekekekekexkoaxkoax album hit the spot. I entered the nap
zone somewhere near the end, but it was a haze of gentle guitar that I
look forward to revisiting.

I have a lot of Le Berger to catch up on, it seems like he’s been fairly
prolific recently. Peaceful as always.

Nathan Michel’s The Beast is one of those albums which has declared
itself a part of my life & here to stay. I like his newer work with
Hospitality but I really wish he’d do a conceptual follow-up to The
Beast. Bit like wishing for a conceptual follow-up to Loveless I guess,
but hey I’m one of those folks who liked MBV, so bring it on!

One memory I always have of this album is blasting it in my dorm room
and a friend coming bursting in to ask what is this?? – he was just
learning some specific style of drumming that is all over this album. I
don’t know enough to say what exactly that means beyond what I can hear
which is a certain type of really precise latency and calculated
sloppiness. We just stood there listening together for a while. “This is
a really hard thing to do!” You could say the same of the construction
and arrangement of the songs – they read as playful and even a little
simplistic on the surface but there’s so much clever neato music nerd
stuff happening under the surface. I guess if this is the album you
write while you’re finishing your composition PhD at Princeton that
stands to reason you’d stick a bit of nerdery under the surface. Still,
it’s all so detailed and wonderful without feeling forced or pretentious
– not an easy feat.

Of course writing all this got me digging around and I was happy to find
a treasure trove of unreleased and out of print music on
=> https://nathanmichel.bandcamp.com Nathan Michel’s bandcamp page
. Including a collection of tracks called Poor Cow that he recorded
between the ages of 15 and 18. I was expecting… well I wasn’t expecting
a polished-sounding 70s rock vibe. A prequel to The Beast? Sure. Amazing
he was already right there with the Hospitality aesthetic 30 years ago.
Also: he’s got a really great singing voice, even as a teen.

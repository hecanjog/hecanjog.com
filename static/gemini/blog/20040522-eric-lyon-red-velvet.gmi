## Eric Lyon - Red Velvet
Posted on 2004-5-22 22:51

I’m very curious, and interested to know, ah, your ideas… In a 1971
lecture on Moment-Forming and Integration, (later published in
Stockhausen on Music) Karlheinz Stockhausen summarized his musical
system, moment form, by reading from a poem by William Blake: “He who
kisses the Joy as it flies / Lives in Eternity’s Sunrise.” Stockhausen’s
moment form is a psychological sum of “beauty and shit” as AGF might put
it. He was interested in a textural, compositional, and contextual soup
of Joycian abrupt changes, where the disparate elements in the work
don’t move progressively; they jump, skitter, and blend in multiplicity
and aesthetic diversity.
Eric Lyon’s Red Velvet takes this Zen-like mode of listening – “the Joy
as it flies” – and stretches it by stitching humor and calculated
abandon into works that leap happily across stylistic divides, while
still managing a surprising and compelling capacity for narrative. This
music, however synthetic, marks its discourse with realism. This is
music for our times, really: self-aware postmodern commentary,
scatterbrain tangents of haunting millennial choirs bleeding into 80s
dance-pop, beauty, silence, computer chip dissonance, and the acute
cynicism of a terrified but enamored, global, and modern people – a
people who are culturally connected for better or worse in a continuum
somewhere between McDonalds homogeneity and Zen detachment. But I just
said to myself, ‘why not?’ Butter, from Red Velvet, begins like some
grand dive off a 28th century Tokyo skyscraper with a whirl of twisted
synthesis and hyperactive textural modulations, jumping and sliding from
hectic to serene and back again before offering the simple rationale:
“why not?” So what’s the overall effect? Simply put, Red Velvet compels
many modes of listening. Lyon’s music all but requires an active and
studied listen, not unlike the concentration involved in soaking in all
layers of a four voice Bach fugue for example. Although Red Velvet
sometimes engages the sort of polyphonic vertical listening Bach’s music
is best suited for, the music overall is a lateral experience. One
moment may stimulate a mode of listening usually associated with the
extreme gestural minimalism of Bernhard Günter. After a short time in
that sound world – usually just enough to establish the musical setting
– a typically graceful transition will then, for example, spring the
music into something requiring a mode of listening usually associated
with the noise-metal band Black Dice.
The real magic of Lyon’s compositions lies in these transitions: the
juxtapositions inform and quite radically transform what might otherwise
be a comfortable or traditional listening experience. And over time an
overall aesthetic impression of the piece emerges, as in Stockhausen’s
moment form. That overall impression has, for me, continually proved to
be restless, unfixed, and hard to qualify. In American Pioneers: Ives to
Cage and Beyond Alan Rich describes the experience of listening to La
Monte Young’s The Well Tuned Piano as “a continuous meditation across a
flood of images. Hearing the work properly,” he continues, “is possible
only by disconnecting oneself with the expectations of classical
harmonies such as Imperial Bösendorfers [the piano Young’s piece was
conceived on] are wont to produce. Freely associating, one hears instead
virtually the entire range of worldwide musical experience.” Red Velvet
clearly encourages this sort of free association, and the spectrum of
musical experience Lyon pans across during the tenure of his recording
is dramatically far-reaching and rewarding in its many facets. Red

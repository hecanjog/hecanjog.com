I think I listened to the Sunday [Jazz Workshop](http://sparetire.radio.af) for more than 16 hours yesterday - I didn't plan to but the playlist was so good... Brent is going to start doing them every Sunday.

_This Is How You Smile_ continues to grow on me.

I moved on to disc two of this Radio Canada comp from 1990 and there are plenty more highlights -- for me probably Marcelle Deschenes' appropriately titled _Big Bang II_ which is all explosions and cool 
spectromorphology as well as David Jaeger's _Fancye_ organ feature are some of the standouts. I also really enjoyed the rhythms and textures in Diana McIntosh's _...and 8;30 in Newfoundland_ as well -- according to 
wikipedia she's worked with Ann Southam who I need to get back into the queue sometime soon! 

This disc ends with a fantastic strumming string drone freakout from James Montgomery called _Saigon_ that also really stands out for me.

It's sort of criminal this comp seems to have been erased from the earth at some point. I stumbled onto it via soulseek -- please, go and find it there, this music deserves to be heard.

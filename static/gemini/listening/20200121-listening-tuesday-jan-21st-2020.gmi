Impossible Grey is one of Günter’s more silent pieces – maybe the most
silent. Despite his suggestion to play these earlier albums quietly, I
do tend to crank them up to at least the point where they are not losing
a battle when the A/C kicks on in my apartment. This EP-length offering
has something like a dozen or so audible events during its 18 minutes.
Something like this which is often gone and only at its most pronounced
barely there maybe seems like a prank, or pretentious, or some other
sort of put-on. The truth is the modesty of its offering is a little
overwhelming. There are so few gestures offered up into your listening
environment – this isn’t just a 4’33" type exercise in activated
listening to the environment, although that’s certainly a happy side
effect. If I could imagine an analog to this album it would be a
transparent overlay on a window, with gem-like points that gently
disturb the light passing through, creating an observable pattern that
sits inside the frame of the window rather than on top of it.

If the appeal is just some incidental dirt smeared on a window, what
exactly is the composer bringing to this? How could it have value if it
could be pumped out in bulk by a child? Without becoming too obsessed
with ego and intention, the fact is every choice in a hyper-restrained
piece like this is a jewel. It’s not important if each gesture was
labored over or chosen freely and easily, each one is a
micro-composition placed inside the listening environment – just an
offering as time passes, a tiny situation that’s gone as quickly as it
arrives and rewards patient and thoughtful listening.

Monochrome Rust / Differential and its companion set Monochrome White /
Polychrome with Neon Nails along with the otherwise unrelated 音丈 (Oto
Dake) for me are a suite of ghost drones. These albums are to my ears
very different from the rest of his work although the Line double-discs
all operate at the edge of perception which was a recurring theme in his
earlier music. Much of Günter’s music, especially the early stuff, is
very gesture-oriented. Points and events placed in space, gestures that
articulate themselves once and never return. They’re story-tellers
without a narrative per se.

This trio of ghost drone albums all create a continuous environment for
their duration. The Line discs sparkle and crackle and seethe with
detail – even more so I listen to these albums loud so as to feel like
I’m inside this world, surrounded by the cellophane echos of that
mysterious Immedia disc. Monochrome White / Polychrome with Neon Nails
was constructed from a nearly-silent disc called In Audio.

I don’t know much of anything about Immedia except that in 1998/1999
they released this disc which captivated Günter enough for him to do two
double-disc reworkings of its near-silent material. The second
double-disc Monochrome Rust / Differential uses the first as its sound
source, and in theory the process could continue forever.

It didn’t though, so I’m content to crank these double albums now and
then and climb into their plastic gauzy sheen for a while.

I felt a little badly writing that basically all recent Another Timbre
albums sound the same a few posts ago. That’s not nearly fair. Simon
Reynell has a very specific vision and appetite which has changed over
the years and currently seems to be settled somewhere in the world of
very understated chamber music. I have tended to listen to batches of
these releases in one day, fairly casually, and so they blend together
from inattention because they’re basically all simpatico, but I
shouldn’t suggest that recent releases on the label are just a parade of
the same thing. That absolutely happens with some genre labels and
Another Timbre is not one of those.

During a Lifetime could easily be mistaken for an album of additive
synthesis at times. The composer is a saxophonist and the opening track
for saxophone ensemble is obviously written with a knowledge of the
instrument. The later pieces feature members of Apartment House and
introduce new timbres like strings and accordion and flute and even
percussion, but each explores a similar smearing world of tone
combination from a different angle. There are precious few events as
such here but it’s not really a drone album either. Like most of the new
Another Timbre stuff it’s very very pretty, but this stands out in its
blurry arrangements and lack of overt patterns.

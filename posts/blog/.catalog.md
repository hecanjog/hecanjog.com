Title: Catalog
Status: Draft


- Each mailing increments the catalog.
- There is an actual catalog, and you can order stuff.
- There are also weird listings, and sometimes orders get extra stuff.
- Not everything is an attempt to communicate.
- Only reveal larger network players when a critical mass has been hit. (2x10?)

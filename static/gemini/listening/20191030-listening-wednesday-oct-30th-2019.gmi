[Angel Olsen / Steve Gunn]

I basically just listened to a bunch of overnight renders of a longform
algorithmic thing I started recently while I worked today, so I didn’t
even make it to side two (the Steve Gunn side) of this Angel Olsen /
Steve Gunn split yet.

The Angel Olsen side is wonderful though, several of the songs overlap
with the record of hers I already have (and know, and love) but it was
fun to hear a few new things and the arrangements on this LP are way
different than the originals. Love that flangy guitar! Pretty nice
recording for a live / festival recording, too. Looking forward to the
Gunn side tomorrow.

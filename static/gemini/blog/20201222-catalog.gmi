## Catalog

Posted on 2020-12-22 20:00

* Each mailing increments the catalog.

* There is an actual catalog, and you can order stuff.

* Not everything is priced in dollars (or other currencies)

* There are also weird listings, and sometimes orders get extra stuff.

* Not everything is an attempt to communicate.

* Only reveal larger network players when a critical mass has been hit.
(2x10?)

* First could be exposed quietly disguised as hubs and batch relaysâ€¦

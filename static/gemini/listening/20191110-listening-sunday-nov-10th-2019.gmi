I think I’ve finally (already) reached the end of the Anomolies catalog,
which primarily consists of alternate versions of their collaborations
with Silent Poets on To Come…. There’s one track listed on discogs that
they are listed as guests on, and they all have at least one or two solo
releases or side projects. So there’s more to look forward to, but I
wish they’d done a whole series of albums with Silent Poets. Those
tracks on To Come… are iconic.

I also finally tracked down (well, in today’s internet – I basically
just decided to look, discovery wasn’t the problem) the original version
of To Come…. My introduction to the album was via the French alternate
cut with a shuffled track order and dub versions of several songs. I was
a little sad to discover that the Anomolies tracks are exactly the same
on both versions, but I liked the non-dub versions of songs I know way
better in their alternate forms, and there was a little Fork In The Road
that was brand new to me. I think I’m glad to have started with the
French version though, because that Ursula Rucker collab is absent from
the original, and that is also a longtime favorite.

I guess I was digging into some new discoveries from old favorites
yesterday since I also made another notch into my Nobukazu Takemura
completism with this really early remix album Minna No Yuenchi that
reworks his first post-hip hop / acid outings as Child’s View in the
most delicious early 2000s broken digital fashion. I’m totally
unfamiliar with the remixers (and for a brief moment of confusion I
thought I’d unearthed yet another alternate solo EP from Takemura) but
making my way through the sadly obscure catalog of Childisc is another
one on my bucket list, so I’m sure I’ll spend more time with them
eventually.

Hard to choose a favorite but that Wunder mix stood out with vocals and
almost pop-ish brevity. I think Asao Kikuchi could have reduced his two
mixes to one, but I can’t blame him for wanting to try every angle with
the original material – that early digital post-turntable Takemura
includes some of his best work.

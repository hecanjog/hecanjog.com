<div class="blog post"><h2>Allegorical Power Series VI
</h2><p class="byline">Posted on 2003-11-17 23:44</p><hr/><p><a href="http://www.antiopic.com/allegorical/november2003.html"><img align="left" src="images/001-aps6.jpg" /></a> <br /> Since June 2003 Antiopic records has been publishing a series of monthly mp3 compilations intended to provoke a socially conscious dialog through <a href="http://www.antiopic.com/allegorical/june2003.html">“abstract or experimental art and music”</a> - discussion of which they consider to be too often limited to matters of aesthetics. Some of the most creative talents in new music have contributed mp3s (and in one case a quicktime movie) to what is turning into some of the most consistetly high-caliber online releases around to date - on par certainly with the likes of <a href="http://www.fallt.com/">Fallt’s</a> popular invalidObject series. <br /> <br /> November’s chapter is smaller than previous releases and unfortunately contains some weaker material than has been presented before. Even so, Volume VI has many high points - such as duul_drv’s moving combination of drones and a field recording of an arrest <i>under words, there is something hidden</i>, as well as Julien Ottavi and Dion Workman’s beautiful <i>Beginning Again</i>, Desist’s lovely and understated <i>Untitled</i>, and We’re Breaking Up’s well balanced microsound collage of radio static <i>Receiver 1</i>. The two remaining contributions from Presocratics and Lovely Midget aren’t failures by any means - they’re simply overshadowed by the strengths of the other releases, not to mention the incredible back-catalog (all of which is still availible for download) of the previous volumes in the series. <br /> <br /> Not every piece of music immediately inspires a socially informed critique, and certainly none is simply an exercise in propaganda - but the very act of enclosing these works in the casing of a suggestion to mindful political consideration gives them another dimension to be unraveled. It’s usually a fun and sometimes challenging task that tends to inform the possible aesthetic readings of the works rather than negating them. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <a href="http://www.antiopic.com/allegorical/november2003.html">http://www.antiopic.com/allegorical/november2003.html</a></p>

[Una Producion Pop]

I downloaded this from an mp3 blog long ago, then lost track of the
blog, but I very much enjoy coming back to this album. (I’ve since found
a cheap used copy as well.) Just a great post-rock outing – reminds me a
bit of Isotope 217 maybe. Great sense of sound & timbre, plenty of
hypnotic freakouts and a solid showing of interesting harmony and subtle
hooks.

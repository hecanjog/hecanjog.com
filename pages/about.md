I\'m a computer musician based in Minnesota.

[I am OK with email.](mailto:erik@hecanjog.com)

[I make open source computer music software.](http://pippi.world)

...and [open source computer music](/projects.html) with it.

Sometimes I use [mastodon](https://merveilles.town/@hecanjog)

I do radio sometimes. 

Some recent generative work for radio is on [Aleatoric Forest](https://phonography.radio.af) right now.

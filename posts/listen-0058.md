Debussy's _Etudes_ three days straight! (Some days multiple listens) 

It's a great ear & soul cleanser when you're in the middle of writing something dense and long-winded...

I have two copies of this Greg Davis EP for no good reason -- but it's a nice one full of sharp space 
and acousmatic shapes. I suppose you could call it a collection of _play-sequences_: a term 
(apparantly coined by Guy Reibel) I'm borrowing from Annette Vande Gorne's _Treatise on Writing 
Acousmatic Music on Fixed Media_  and which I think means something along the lines of an 
intutive story told through the methods of energy-movement, morphology, space and color-spectra. 

I really like Davis' angular shape-music. He seemed much more interested in those sound worlds earlier on 
in his career, and for a while at least got more focused on space and tone with a number of tone combination 
and synth ambient type excursions. (Or so it seemed to me -- I've missed a few of the newer ones & look forward 
to catching up.) In any case his newest (_throughline_) seems like a marriage of the two (as long as I'm unfairly 
dumping everything he's done into buckets) worlds: angular sound-shapes (mostly) frozen in space and time.

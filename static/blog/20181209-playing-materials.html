<div class="blog post"><h2>Playing Materials
</h2><p class="byline">Posted on 2018-12-9 20:00</p><hr/><p>When I started working on the original version of this project in 2011 it was going to be a book – I created the initial version of my <code>pippi</code> computer music system to realize it. I figured I would need at least a year to get somewhere, but seven years later the project has changed a lot and I’m not in such a rush to get to the end anymore.</p>
<p>To be clear the initial idea had nothing to do with Pippi Longstocking or any of Astrid Lindgren’s work. I was interested in making a self-generating book, the contents of which would be a mixture of the source code to produce the book, a story told in prose comments, (plus simple tricks like naming progam entities after elements in the story etc) commands to be typed into an accompanying sound-producing CLI program, and line drawings. I recently found some notes I made about that version which placed the code and prose comments on each left-side page, additional narration, color-coded commands and line drawings on each right-side page.</p>
<p>The story itself, the accompanying audio program, the line drawings were all meant to be produced from a single seed-word. Editions would be reproducable by simply hashing the input word and using the resulting number as a seed for the random number generator.</p>
<p>I wanted to break the story into chapters, the first of which would present each environment in the story minus the characters - this is the way the Ramayana starts off. (Or so I’ve heard having only read the great and short modern retelling by R.K. Narayan!)</p>
<p>In this version of the project, the experience was a solo venture. I was thinking in part of playing old text-based adventure games via the command interface, as well as the hybrid approach of the Broderbund Carmen Sandiego games, which would come with a facts / world history book that you were meant to consult during gameplay. But essentially the idea at this point was you would sit down and read this book, typing commands into the computer to signal shifts in the audio part, and construct the immersive details in your mind, as you might when reading any other story.</p>
<p>I never managed to work out a story, all my efforts went into adding affordances to the software system and doing musical studies with it. (That’s basically been the point to all the music I’ve made since 2011, with a few exceptions.) But in the end it’s a hell of a thing to write a good story, and I just couldn’t find my way into it. It’s much easier to obsess over technical things than try to <em>say</em> something.</p>
<p>Anyway in this most recent study I decided I really needed to engage with stories, and a way into it could be to start by studying and retelling a story I liked – I like how the Ramayana has life in this way, constantly being retold and reshaped. I read the Pippi Longstocking stories as a kid, and their kindly fuck-you attitude was inspiring. Pippi didn’t take any shit, did what she pleased grown-ups be damned, and she was kind and thoughtful while she did it, so I’m going with that for now.</p>
<p>I had the chance to do something in a non-traditional space, and I thought I would give this new story-based study a shot finally. Because of the built-in format (an audience arriving at the venue with zero background on the project, and lots of expectations for what it means to experience a “performance” in music) things started to change a lot in the group context.</p>
<p>In this version there would be 4 laptops and 4 VOIP phones, plus one laptop connected to a projecter and all of the smartphones that the audience happened to bring with them – instead of a single laptop and a book.</p>
<p>The laptops and the smartphones would display the <em>scene</em> corresponding to the current place in the story, consisting of avatars, backgrounds, and optional titles. Here’s the Pippi avatar:</p>

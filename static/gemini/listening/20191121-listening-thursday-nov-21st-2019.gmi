I finally sat down with Brent’s new album today – which is actually a
reissue of the audio portion of
=> https://www.discogs.com/Brent-Gutzeit-Four-Compositions/release/1911863 a 2007 CD/DVD release on his Trust Lost label
. I’d love to see the DVD portion re-released someday which includes two
performances of Composition 32 (performed by an 11 piece ensemble) and a
solo performance of Composition 30 for Computer, Turntable and
Cigarette. I feel like Brent told me a little about the Composition 30
performance, and if my memory serves the computer does not survive it,
but maybe I’m thinking of something else.

Anyway the two audio recordings that were recently reissued on JMY are
also large ensemble recordings – with a stellar lineup of improvisers
including Jason Roebke, Aaron Zarzutzki, Kevin Drumm and many others.

Composition 36a was recorded at Elastic Arts as part of the Chicago
Sound Map festival and was performed by the

(which has also released performances of compositions by Olivia Block
and Ernst Karel). Composition 36b was recorded later the same year at
Jason Soliday’s venue Enemy by the

which adds 12 members to the core TV Pow trio of Gutzeit, Todd Carter &
Michael Hartman.

These pieces sound very much like a group of people in a room playing
Brent’s music. I mean, that’s what it is! But the performances really
retain all the qualities of his acousmatic / collage work – the wide
dynamic range, moments of balanced extreme density, lightswitch shifts
and timbral contrasts, the presence of harmony inside a context of sound
mass that makes the harmony sound other-worldly and naturalistic for
lack of a better way to put it… With a large ensemble (also featuring
electronics) playing often dense & partially improvised music like this
the typical outcome is mumbling mush, but these both have a clarity and
precision to them that is not easy to accomplish.

Brent actually reminded me recently that I have the Roland Kayn box set
and have so far listened to only one disc! Oops. The second disc picks
right up where the first left off – pure texture gymnastics and clusters
of tape on tape on tape on tape. I’d be satisfied if the whole
collection never strayed from this trajectory but I am curious to know
if there is a meta-structure to the collection spanning across the
discs. Anyway I’m happy to have many more ahead to listen to.

I was ready and expecting to like this Greg Kelley album, but what I
wasn’t really expecting is how narratively suggestive it would feel to
me. The opening begins with a patient exploration of basically a single
sound object repeated perfectly but erratically and with sparing
interruptions from a rupturing chaotic sound mass that will reveal
itself completely later.

I can’t see the timer on my CD player so I’m not sure when, but after a
while, this re-exploration of the same sound object starts to have a
psychedelic effect. I can’t remember how long I’ve been listening. Is it
still repeating or is this new? It’s so familiar I can’t even hear it
anymore. And it starts to get trying, there is palpable tension by the
time the chaos finally overwhelms it completely. When that happens and
it finally stops repeating, the long undulating and never-repeating
chaos (well, I think it does repeat almost in entirety once, but the
effect is more like a callback to a memory of the previous tension than
an actual tension) is such a welcome release from the increasingly
tedious re-presentation of that initial sound object.

Hey, like life! I really don’t want to get too literal with the
interpretation of the title, but the drama that that the sounds present
really does fit a tidy little pantomime of life as intricate tedium,
with the threat of the unknown (death) looming. The section following
the chaos of death which is a release into a static low frequency
texture could be the calming stasis of the (lack of) afterlife…

After that comes a short revisit of the intro, and again a launch into
chaos but this time the chaos stabilizes into something pretty &
organized at regular intervals. And then there is another more melodic
iteration of the chaos, followed with a comparatively angelic drone-like
section and well my little story falls apart completely after that.
(Hey, like life! No, no just kidding.)

This record is probably as it suggests on the tin: just a nice edit of a
bunch of live recordings paired with a provocative title. The drama of
the arrangement of the excerpts is suggestive though. So, choose your
own adventure.

All this said, I guess I prefer what feels like the less formalistic
approach taken in the second half / final two-thirds of this which to me
seems like more of a straightforward parade of nice textures & long
gestures with more overall variation and a throughline you can lose
yourself in if you’re not careful.

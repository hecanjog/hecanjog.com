<h1 id="cabin-yearly-timeline">Cabin Yearly Timeline</h1>
<p>A rough timeline for buying land and building a series of increasingly complex structures culminating finally with moving full time into a livable cabin / tiny house.</p>
<h2 id="section">2021</h2>
<p>The first year is about securing the land, setting up a temporary space I can work from part time, and learning how to build stuff.</p>
<p>I’ll try to start by constructing a small cellar-like storage area, buried into the ground where I can store a tent and all supplies for setting up the temporary workspace that aren’t safe to keep outdoors year-round.</p>
<p>(And maybe first an even simpler storage box for tools so I can leave them safely onsite, too…)</p>
<p>By the summer, with the temporary space setup, I’ll start building the first tiny structure – a tiny cabin similar to one I saw someone else build with a minimal foundation and a single window &amp; door, as well as a wood stove.</p>
<p>By the winter it should be possible to use the tiny house as my part time work space instead of an outdoor tent.</p>
<p>Besides my dayjob, some of my time working here will be toward small projects meant to help me transition back to being mostly self-employed after I finally move out of my apartment. Developing pay-what-you-want audio tools, creating some web service side projects, etc…</p>
<p>This year should also be the start of a process of getting rid of crap I’ve been storing but will never need and/or would just clutter up the cabin. I’ll need as much leeway as I can to clutter it up good with records and books anyway. ;-)</p>
<p>I should also work on switching to a lower power setup at home, use solar at the temporary tent site, and start making meals that would be easy to make with the facilities I’ll have in the final fulltime cabin. (So also think about what those should be!)</p>
<ul>
<li>January - June: Save for deposit on land purchase loan</li>
<li>June: have property assessed &amp; buy it</li>
<li>June: begin hideaway box build &amp; save for tiny house construction</li>
<li>July: setup temporary tented remote work space, stored primarily in hideawy box</li>
<li>August: begin tiny house construction</li>
<li>November: finish tiny house construction &amp; move work space inside</li>
<li>December: enjoy tiny house, continue to setup inside</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-1">2022</h2>
<p>The second year is about getting more serious about tiny house construction, and investigating plumbing hookups. (It would be possible to go fully on-grid here, but running water &amp; waste disposal of some kind is all I’m interested in long-term. Otherwise as long as I still can get a phone signal to tether to an internet connection, and I can rig up enough solar power for my needs, water &amp; trash should be the only services I’ll buy into in the long term.</p>
<p>This second tiny house should also strive to meet the requirements for a Minnesota dwelling, as practice for the final fulltime cabin.</p>
<ul>
<li>January - March: save for second tiny house</li>
<li>March - September: second tiny house construction – add plumbing?</li>
<li>September - December: enjoy second tiny house, save for cabin construction</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-2">2023</h2>
<p>The third year I’ll just save and try to start construction on the fulltime cabin as soon as possible. Likely red tape will suck, though at least Minnesota has special rules for tiny houses that seem a bit less hardcore than those for a dwelling larger than 500 square feet.</p>
<p>I really doubt I will be able to build the cabin in a single year. If so, because of the timing of my apartment lease, nothing would change anyway besides having much more time to finish moving out.</p>
<p>This year I’ll still only be using the tiny houses as a part time work space and living full time at my apartment.</p>
<p>By this time I’d like to have a financial plan in place for when I go into the cabin full time and transition back to part time or contract work so I can budget and save accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li>January - March: enjoy second tiny house, keep saving</li>
<li>March - September: cabin construction</li>
<li>September - December: stop cabin construction</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-3">2024</h2>
<p>The fourth year I’ll do my best to finish the cabin enough so it is ready to live in during the winter, and ready to move into full time the following year. We’ll see!</p>
<ul>
<li>January - March: stop cabin construction</li>
<li>March - September finish cabin</li>
<li>September - December: enjoy cabin</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-4">2025</h2>
<p>The fifth year I’ll actually move out of my apartment and move in to the cabin full time with my cat.</p>
<p>At this point consider splitting a small commerical space in town to make a hackerspace with friends, and do electronics work there… maybe house a community server there as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>January - March: enjoy cabin &amp; move rest of stuff out of apartment</li>
<li>March: Move Louis to cabin</li>
<li>April: give up lease on apartment</li>
<li>May: setup hackerspace?</li>
</ul>

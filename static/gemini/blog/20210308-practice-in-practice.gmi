## Practice in practice

Posted on 2021-03-08 20:00

In 2011 I put my musicial life on hold with the intention of going into
the workshop with a burning idea and coming out the other side
transformed.

I didn’t know what the other side would look like, and in the excitement
of it all decided it would be best to announce the album I’d just
finished as my last using the He Can Jog name. Norwood, Wisconsin felt
at the time like the best articulation of that project I was capable of
producing, and I was eager to move on.

Not just move on from the sound of whatever it was I’d decided was my
sound at the time (silly) but move into a new form of practice, finally
engaging fully with ideas and approaches I’d only really let myself
tinker on in the past: now they’d become center stage. A new chapter.

</ul>
<p>Some brief observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>On <em>Hollerin’ The Spirit</em>: this band really took shape – all the energy and angst of Cap’n Jazz plus timbre for miles.</li>
<li>On <em>A Little Electronic Milky Way Of Sound</em>: only six discs in and I’m starting to think of this as a single piece in multiple variations. Not looking forward to running out of discs.</li>
<li>On <em>Standing On A Hummingbird</em> and <em>Inland</em>: Mark Templeton is one of the great practitioners of 2nd or 3rd wave ambient/glitch or whatever you want to call it. (1st wave french post-concrete 80s &amp; 90s digital folks, 2nd wave bedroom laptop researchers like Fennesz, Opiate, etc?) I slept on these in the day and they’re fantastic.</li>
<li>On <em>Five Points Fincastle</em>: this was at the very top of my list circa 2004 and hasn’t aged a day since. <em>I was there for the last kiss</em> is still so gorgeous.</li>
<li>On <em>Heritage</em>: I can’t keep up! I think I’m about 30 hours behind on new KFW and that’s just from the last few months. (I don’t really know how many hours.) It’s honestly inspiring though. I’m in a similar place with non-realtime generative projects and maybe I need to start releasing them the way I listen to them myself – as sprawling lakes of undulating process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Update, the morning after: sometimes I publish these entries having just put on the last thing for the day. I couldn’t make it through this new KFW last night. I’ll have to try again when I’m in the right headspace. I’m not totally sure the bandcamp data-dump is the right way to present all this. I’m probably biased but I can’t help but feel like an internet radio stream would be much better…</p>

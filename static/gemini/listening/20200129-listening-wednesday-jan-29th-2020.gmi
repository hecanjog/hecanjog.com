Well, I only ended up writing a short rant about Peabo Bryson & Roberta
Flack’s Born To Love, so here it is.

## In Defense of Born To Love 

If you can set aside the incredibly schlocky 80s love ballad lyrics –
heavy-handed and precisely dramatic gestures of eternal love and
everything is forever and boundless etc etc. Just get over it, because
underneath there is actually a lot of great music on Born To Love.

Blame It On Me and Heaven Above Me feel like stand-outs but the winner
of top-schlock lyrical content while remaining a pretty great song is
the groan-worthy Tonight, I Celebrate My Love. Really, get over it and
bask in the rolling waves of rhodes-like guitar and soft arrangements.

The record stays surprisingly on point until Comin’ Alive. Just skip
that one, and maybe call it a day after I Just Came Here To Dance.
Robbie Buchanan’s synth programming at times echos Giorgio Moroder’s
synths in Limahl’s Neverending Story, but there’s just too much garbage
swirling around it to salvage Comin’ Alive.

After that unfortunate turn, the record kind of wimpers away. The synth
brass in You’re Looking Like Love is fun but the song feels like a poor
soundalike of much better material from the same record – like Maybe!
Unfortunately Can We Find Love Again is another mostly forgettable genre
exercise.

That said, before giving it a chance, I assumed the whole record would
be a series of forgettable genre exercises. There are some seriously
great songs and breaks in here, with the standard content disclaimer for
the over-the-top schlocky narrative premise.

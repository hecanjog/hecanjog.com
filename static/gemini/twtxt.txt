2020-08-21T12:44:00-05:00	Testing first post...
2020-08-21T12:57:00-05:00	There are lots of cool clients and tools for twtxt... but I think I'd rather play with rolling my own given how simple the format is for everything. I suppose that's the point. :-)
2020-08-22T16:18:00-05:00	Might cobble together a little personal twtxt timeline today...
2020-08-22T16:58:00-05:00	It's extremely basic but I like that I could cobble together a twtxt feed reader so easily. I'd like better formatting & mention support, but it's something!
2020-08-22T17:06:00-05:00	I don't think I'll drop mastodon soon, but I love that I could "join" a social network so to speak by writing a few dozen lines of code.
2020-08-25T23:06:00-05:00	Slow day, slow week...
2020-08-26T19:32:00-05:00	Back to using an old netbook as a text terminal connected to my work computer so I can hide the big monitor and feel like I'm blocking out the world for a little bit...

2020-09-03T17:31:00-05:00	It's a bit comforting to post here. Even though it's in some sense extremely public, because barely anyone uses twtxt it feels a bit more like posting in a private journal. It would be nice to have mult-line posts, I suppose, but I can always start a clog. :-)
2020-09-03T17:33:00-05:00	I'm starting to doubt that I will ever finish Finnegans Wake, although I'm too stubborn to accept it yet. It's still fun to read aloud, and the language is beautiful, but it goes and goes and goes... anyway there's no rush to finish. I suppose I'll keep sipping from it as long as I like...
2020-09-03T17:36:00-05:00	@<https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> twtxt via DNS TXT would be insane and fun.
2020-09-05T23:46:00-05:00	Hm, I sorta want to re-read Foucault's Pendulum already.
2020-09-20T19:26:00-05:00	Capping off the evening with The Second Dream of the High-Tension Line Stepdown Transformer From the Four Dreams of China.
2020-09-22T17:36:00-05:00	Happiness is a readable process list in htop
2020-09-28T21:58:00-05:00	I'm doing a thing that involves working with an external MIDI module (really, just another computer) for the first time in a long while. The realtime flow is weird, and makes want to set up some automated recording dealy so I can more easily fit everything into my usual workflow...
2020-09-28T22:50:00-05:00	Oh, OK that was actually really easy to set up. I can just run a MIDI playback script and end up with a local recording of an external module. Not super interesting but quite nice! :-)
2020-11-06T09:54:00-06:00	Before the pandemic hit in March, I'd spent the year without TV or movies. It didn't last through the lockdown, but I think I'm finally through a very long hump where I let myself melt into some distractions. I don't regret these periods, I like TV and movies, they're not only distractions, they can also be great storytellers. Still, it's good to finally feel like I need a break and I can take the time for other things again... I usually go in waves, pick it up, put it down, but this was a long one.
2020-11-06T10:02:00-06:00	At the same time I have to admit I've been more productive creatively this year than most years. I think that has more to do with Pippi getting fairly mature, enough at least that I need to spend far less time on Pippi itself, and far more time using it (and other things!) to make things.
2020-11-09T11:11:00-06:00	Got my personal blog a little further along last night... trying to decide if I want to weave this twtxt feed directly into my site, too, or leave it as a little secret corner of the web...
2020-11-09T13:36:00-06:00	Collaborative composition is tough. I think I tend to ruin things with ideas and plans. Lets hope I'm not doing it now!
2020-11-10T14:14:09-06:00	Whoops! Fixing the timestamps in my feed thanks to a hat tip from @<xandkar https://xandkar.net/twtxt.txt>
2020-11-11T12:03:39-06:00	@<xandkar https://xandkar.net/twtxt.txt> :thumbsup:
2020-11-11T12:03:57-06:00	2020 is all about yearning
2020-11-11T20:04:39-06:00	If there's a freshman 15, I think I've put on my pandemic 50.
2020-11-14T11:50:09-06:00	Think I'll make another batch of hemp muffins today...
2020-11-14T17:59:54-06:00	I think I want to get into curries this winter.
2020-11-15T09:45:48-06:00	OK, not too shabby. I just tried my first search with gemini and immediately found a delicious looking curry recipe. (Of course in beautiful plain text instead of 5 pages of ads and photos.)
2020-11-15T15:38:13-06:00	Hello gemini! gemini://hecanjog.com
2020-11-16T11:08:48-06:00	I've been making a daily ritual to run a fan and open the windows to circulate the air in my apartment. It's lovely, even in 20 degree weather -- I'm curious if I'll be able to do it when it's negative 20 too.
2020-11-16T12:05:13-06:00	I remember now why I stopped baking for a while. Because after I bake it, I eat it. Not as easy to dump most of my bakes off on friends during the pandemic, but I guess I'm going to try to drown my cousin in muffins so I don't eat em all.
2020-11-22T12:33:26-06:00	Looking at my firefox history, I made a list of the 21 sites I visit most often. Dreaming basically of pulling all the news-type sites into one static gemini page that updates every day... and seeing if there are CLI or other text-based alternatives for others. Some are hopeless -- like my bank's website... but I bet I could keep my web browser closed much more often if I put a little work into this...
2020-11-22T16:17:43-06:00	So little drive to do anything today... days like this I usually end up tinkering on my website though... I just banished my tablet to a box on a shelf (waiting to be given away) so that feels like something accomplished for the day, anyway...
2020-11-22T19:23:34-06:00	As predicted, I messed around with my site tonight. Maybe I'll do a bit more. It already feels really nice to be touchscreen-free. <3

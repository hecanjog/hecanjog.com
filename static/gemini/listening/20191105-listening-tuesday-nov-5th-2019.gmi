[Music Around Benjamin Boretz: Open Spaces, 2005]

This post has been sitting in my drafts queue for too long, I’ll just
say the highlight of this (pretty extensive) compilation is J.K.
Randall’s benfest reworking of Boretz’ UN(-). I swear to god if you
scribbled Nobukazu Takemura’s name onto this I wouldn’t have batted an
eye. I need to catch up with 21st century J.K. Randall. I dig the
playful and clustery mixture between slick general MIDI FM synth module
vibes and sharp arrangements. (Which could also describe a fair amount
of Takemura’s work!) Maybe Randall is less risky with timbre and a bit
more restless with thematic material, but I couldn’t stop marveling at
the kindred spirits I was hearing between these two.

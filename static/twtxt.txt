2020-08-21T12:44-05:00	Testing first post...
2020-08-21T12:57-05:00	There are lots of cool clients and tools for twtxt... but I think I'd rather play with rolling my own given how simple the format is for everything. I suppose that's the point. :-)
2020-08-22T16:18-05:00	Might cobble together a little personal twtxt timeline today...
2020-08-22T16:58-05:00	It's extremely basic but I like that I could cobble together a twtxt feed reader so easily. I'd like better formatting & mention support, but it's something!
2020-08-22T17:06-05:00	I don't think I'll drop mastodon soon, but I love that I could "join" a social network so to speak by writing a few dozen lines of code.
2020-08-25T23:06-05:00	Slow day, slow week...
2020-08-26T19:32-05:00	Back to using an old netbook as a text terminal connected to my work computer so I can hide the big monitor and feel like I'm blocking out the world for a little bit...

2020-09-03T17:31-05:00	It's a bit comforting to post here. Even though it's in some sense extremely public, because barely anyone uses twtxt it feels a bit more like posting in a private journal. It would be nice to have mult-line posts, I suppose, but I can always start a clog. :-)
2020-09-03T17:33-05:00	I'm starting to doubt that I will ever finish Finnegans Wake, although I'm too stubborn to accept it yet. It's still fun to read aloud, and the language is beautiful, but it goes and goes and goes... anyway there's no rush to finish. I suppose I'll keep sipping from it as long as I like...
2020-09-03T17:36-05:00	@<https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> twtxt via DNS TXT would be insane and fun.
2020-09-05T23:46-05:00	Hm, I sorta want to re-read Foucault's Pendulum already.

#### Updates

*June 4th 2021* I only had half an avocodo on hand today, the mixture is lumpy. I'll remember to save the whole thing next time. :)

*June 1st 2021* I _love_ the way the cherry & apricot flavors combine. I can't taste the strawberries but I imagine they add something!

- Added apricots
- Reduced blend times again

*May 29th 2021* Tried fresh mango and strawberries

- Added strawberries
- Replaced frozen mango with fresh mango

*May 26th 2021* It's much better without the peanut butter

- Removed the peanut butter

*May 24th 2021* An improvement! Next time back to 2 tablespoons of peanut butter though.

- Added an avocado and removed a banana
- Added 1/2 cup more water
- Added 1 heaping tsp of turmeric
- Increased peanut butter from 2 tablespoons to 3. (I liked the interaction with the cherry but now it covers the cherry a little too much)
- Reduced blend times

This early Coco Bees album is one of my favorites – heavy on the
guitar-stuttering tricks Chris Rosenau has perfected over the years,
abstract without veering too far from what it is abstracting… Jon
Mueller sounds like a young man on this! I didn’t remember him singing
on it, but there is no contemporary chant-style intonation here, just
pure teen heart-throb indie crooning.

I haven’t heard Man Or Astro-Man? since the 90s – they were one of those
bands I’d hear at band rehearsal or listen to with friends but I never
fully got into myself. I guess not much has changed. Funny since I’ve
developed a love of surf music as an adult – well, I guess it’s more
accurate to say I’ve developed a love for Alan Jenkins surf projects…
and Man Or Astro-Man? has plenty of studio electronics smeared here and
there, a cheeky sense of humor… I don’t know. It doesn’t really work for
me for some reason. I almost turned the album off several times. The one
highlight was track 9 which was a 90 second pop song that sounded like
it was recorded inside of a dumpster, during a dumpster fire. That was
very nice! Points also for the cheeky robot synth ending, but I might
not come back to another Man Or Astro-Man? album for another 20 years or
so…

Spill’s Fluoresce is hard to describe, but Tony Buck’s skittery drums
and Magda Mayas’ crystalline pianos and misc implements are a match made
in heaven. They have two other records I haven’t heard yet!

<p>Today was the yearly <em>Richard D. James Album</em> listen. Now that I’m actually writing it all down, I kind of wonder in a few years if I’ll be able to spot certain records like these that I <em>think</em> I’ve been playing about once a year or so for 15 or 20 years and more. Curious to see if that’s actually the case.</p>
<p>I’m also curious to see if eventually I’ll be able to see some listening patterns for certain records, and maybe even make groups out of them. Some records like 4Hero’s <em>Two Pages</em> when I put them on, sometimes they keep coming back to the turntable on a daily basis for days until I finally get it out of my system. That’s how I remember it feeling for some things anyway, I wonder if that’ll be the case too.</p>
<p>I haven’t listened to this AWE record (full disclosure Andrew used some of my bleeps and computer donks on it) in a long enough time that listening felt really fresh again. I can see this also becoming one of those yearly forever records…</p>

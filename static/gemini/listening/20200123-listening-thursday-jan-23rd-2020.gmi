Too engrossed in a music project tonight to write much.

Haim’s Days Are Gone is a classic and I can’t wait to hear the one
they’re teasing with new singles now. The last one felt like a weird
misstep but the new singles seem to go back to what they do best:
playing rock and roll very well.

So much I wanted to write about this relatively obscure Nobukazu
Takemura album which comes at an interesting point in his solo career…
another time!

Finally: Phonem’s Hydro Electric defines the IDM genre and is the best
offering of its era. A nuanced view!

Today was the yearly _Richard D. James Album_ listen. Now that I'm actually writing it all down, 
I kind of wonder in a few years if I'll be able to spot certain records like these that I _think_ 
I've been playing about once a year or so for 15 or 20 years and more. Curious to see if that's actually the case.

I'm also curious to see if eventually I'll be able to see some listening patterns for certain records, and maybe even 
make groups out of them. Some records like 4Hero's _Two Pages_ when I put them on, sometimes they keep coming back 
to the turntable on a daily basis for days until I finally get it out of my system. That's how I remember it 
feeling for some things anyway, I wonder if that'll be the case too.

I haven't listened to this AWE record (full disclosure Andrew used some of my bleeps and computer donks on it) 
in a long enough time that listening felt really fresh again. I can see this also becoming one of those 
yearly forever records...

<div class="blog post"><h2>Some Random Numbers in Python
</h2><p class="byline">Posted on 2020-12-22 20:00</p><hr/><p>This article isn’t really about python. It’s not really about random numbers either – especially not about their applications in cryptographic contexts. This article is about <em>using</em> random within the context of a larger compositional scheme with freedom and confidence. You’re a real composer too, even though you let that that random number call the shots just now.</p>
<p>If you know me, you’ve probably heard me get on my soapbox about how in the world of generative art simple algorithms often produce more interesting outputs than terribly or clever alogrithms, and that working with random number generators is perfectly useful and good and not bad or scary or wrong at all. It may seem strange to emphasize that last point, but random numbers have a surprisingly bad reputation in generative art circles. If you can come away from this with a couple new things to think about, and a cool thumbs-up attitude towards using these random number tools in your work, I’ll be quite happy! I’ll try to demonstrate how random numbers can be so useful and also why you don’t need to do much anything fancy with them to get a lot of benifet from them.</p>
<p>I’m not going to describe anything clever, just some basic approaches to working with random number generators that I find generally useful and interesting. Every example will be implementated in my python computer music system called pippi, where I use them the most, but the ideas can be implemented in pretty much any system or language with a random number generator and some math library functions. I don’t use all of these approaches all the time, but I do use some of them quite a lot of the time. I’ll try to point out which those are, and I’m also excited to dig up some personally overlooked techniques by writing through this all, so I’ll try to point those out too.</p>
<p>Lets start with using a <em>normal</em> or <em>uniform</em> random distribution. This is the random distribution you’re probably already most comfortable working with: white noise, with energy spread nearly equally across the frequency spectrum.</p>
<p>When people talk about the <em>distribution</em> of a random number producer, all they’re talking about is sampling its output for a while and then making a graph of those outputs, sorted. For a descrete system (where there aren’t any answers in between the steps) this is essentially a histogram of the random number generator’s production within some range.</p>
<p>A white noise, normal run-of-the-mill plane jane random distribtion will just look basically like a straight line. Each value is roughly as probable as any other to be chosen.</p>

</figure>
<p>Above I ran a standard random number generator 10,000 times, sorted the outputs and we get basically a straight line going from 0 to 1 at a rate of about 1/1.</p>
<p>As I said, this is showing every value produced in that run of 100,000 values. The line is quite flat, showing that each value between 0 and 1 has nearly the same weight – in other words, nearly the same probability that it will be chosen.</p>
<p>There are quite a lot of possible values between 0 and 1 in a 64 bit system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the meantime</em>, consider the shape of the graph of the normal distribution, and try to imagine how you might go about changing that in practice, without rewriting the C standard library to alter the <code>rand()</code> function itself. Ultimately C’s <code>rand()</code> is what pippi uses for random number generation. For musical purposes, it’s mighty fine albeit a tad clunky in the API area. Just don’t use it in your new privacy application to generate random secrets. Pippi does hide the clunky parts but it <em>does</em> expect you to seed the random number generator with some number.</p>

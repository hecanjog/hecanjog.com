This post has been sitting in my drafts queue for too long, I'll just say the highlight of this (pretty extensive) compilation is 
J.K. Randall's _benfest_ reworking of Boretz' _UN(-)_. I swear to god if you scribbled Nobukazu Takemura's 
name onto this I wouldn't have batted an eye. I need to catch up with 21st century J.K. Randall. I dig the 
playful and clustery mixture between slick general MIDI FM synth module vibes and sharp arrangements. (Which 
could also describe a fair amount of Takemura's work!) Maybe Randall is less risky with timbre and a bit more 
restless with thematic material, but I couldn't stop marveling at the kindred spirits I was hearing between these two.

## Reading Notes

### Mims, Forrest M., Getting Started in Electronics

#### Chapter 1

I learned in a Khan academy video that electrical current is really just electrons that 
get bumped loose from the orbit of an atom, making the atom into a positively charged ion. 
Since the negatively charged electron hit the road the atom now has fewer electrons than 
protons and so it is said to be positively charged. Free electrons will pop right into the 
empty slot left behind and return it to a neutral charge... when the reverse happens -- 
an extra electron enters the orbit of a normal atom, that atom becomes negatively charged 
because of the proton/electron imbalance and is said to be a negative ion.

The idea of some atoms having electrons that are easy to pop around -- like the atoms in 
conductive materials -- basically makes sense. Mims further explains how that popping around 
can happen with a series of experiments though, and it's interesting to think about how 
so many different physical ... processes I guess? can stimulate electrical movement. Mims 
calls out *friction*, *light*, *heat* and *chemicals* specifically. Thinking in those terms 
makes the idea of current a little less mysterious...

The other major breakthrough for me so far with this chapter is *static electricity*! I 
never really thought much about it, or what it actually is... but knowing all static electricity 
means is that there are electrons resting on some surface (a negative static electrical charge 
which will flow into the first thing that conducts toward a positively charged ion) OR that 
the atoms on the surface of some material all got their electrons knocked off orbit and so 
the surface consists of positively charged ions, just hanging out there being a positive 
static electrical charge.

That actually makes current which I've struggled with a bit in the past feel understandable. 

Still, I don't yet *grok* these relationships. The metaphor of water pressure for voltage 
makes sense on its own -- it's intuitive to think of *potential charge* in terms of water  
pressure caused by the weight of a reservoir pushing itself through a lower spigot and the 
speed of the water rushing through being the current (this is the easiest to grok IMHO
since it's literally a measure of electrons per second that pass some given point) and I 
also basically see how the analogy of resistance being the friction caused by forcing the 
water through the spigot since I can imagine different materials having more or less 
difficult atomic landscapes to circumnavigate... but I still don't really grok potential 
energy and voltage in physical terms. Is it just a measure of static charge at the starting 
end of DC flow?

I basically get "power" as well which I don't see used much in things that I've read, but 
a definition of basically "the component that does the work" makes sense to me. 

Speaking of DC flow! This chapter explained the difference between AC and DC current so 
clearly I feel like I must have it wrong since it's so simple... anyway my understanding 
is that all DC / direct current means is a current that flows in one direction. There is 
also an associated *voltage drop* as the electrons flow through the system and experience 
resistance... at least I think that's how the voltage drop happens?

AC or alternating current is interesting. Mims says it is typically produced by spinning a 
coil inside a magnetic field, though how exactly that produces the alternation of flow from 
one direction to another I'm not sure. It's clear enough though that the oscillation produces 
a sinewave motion and I at least can acknowledge that there is an additional property of AC that 
tends to encourage electron flow in adjacent sections of the circuit, and so is suitable for 
long-distance power transmission where DC would suffer from a voltage drop from the resistance 
caused by traveling a great distance over the wire. (Which also jives with what J was telling me 
about a *huge* mistake I made in my original approach to a little solenoid circuit which placed 
the power source next to the controller instead of the solenoid... and the voltage drop 
made the solenoid behave poorly. (Gummy action, sometimes barely activating, etc.)

The really mindblowing section of this chapter though is the page that describes simply how to 
make a basic solenoid AND a motor (of sorts) from just a plastic straw, iron nail, copper wire 
and a battery. So OF COURSE I'm going to play around with that! Amazing.
